Fortunately, for customers that were unable to pre-order the iPhone 6 due to carrier issues, Apple has provided a 24-hour reservation window to proceed with the order.\n\nInstead of receiving a purchase confirmation from Apple, these customers have received a reservation number that for the iPhone model that was attempted to be pre-ordered that could be used when carrier systems were working properly again. Now that hours have passed and the pre-order rush has inevitably slowed down, Apple has notified affected customers by email to complete their orders.\n\nA significant portion of the emails have a 24 hour time window, while others are dated for the morning of September 14th. Apple will remove the reserved iPhone from their system if the transaction is not completed within the stated timeframe. In that case, customers will have to camp out at Apple Stores or authorized resellers ahead of the September 19th launch for their best chance at securing a new iPhone 6.\n\nThere is no doubt that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will likely be two of the hottest selling smartphones this holiday shopping season, particularly because they are the first iPhones to have large screen sizes akin to Android-based smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Samsung Galaxy Note. Moreover, the iPhone 6 is a more noteworthy update compared to the iPhone 5s and could prompt more old iPhone users to upgrade.\n\nApple introduced the iPhone 6 at its product event on Tuesday afternoon. The company and carriers began accepting pre-orders for the smartphones on September 12th with a public launch to follow on September 19th in the\u00a0United States, France, Hong Kong, Canada, Germany, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Australia and Japan, and several other countries on September 26th.\n\nWere you able to pre-order the iPhone 6?", "wordchoice": ["based", "with", "two", "pre", "more", "smartphones", "customers", "ahead", "received", "and", "to", "Samsung"], "title": "Apple offers 24-hour reservation window to iPhone 6 customers with pre-ordering issues"}, {"url": "http://feeds.iphonehacks.com/~r/iphonehacks/~3/07dTkHy6zfM/ios-8s-sms-continuity-delayed.html", "corpus": "iOS 8 adds a number of new features to iPhones and iPads, but one that I was particularly looking forward to was SMS Continuity, which would let users reply to standard SMSes from their Macs and iPads as long as the iPhone is nearby.\n\nIt turns out that the feature is delayed until October, according to Apple\u2019s updated webpage on iOS 8\u2019s Continuity features.\n\nContinuity relies on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and we suspect that the delay has got to do something with OS X Yosemite, which is still in beta and won\u2019t be releasing until October.

For one, English has more than one word for snow\u2014powder, flurry, pack, slush, hail, sleet, ice, black ice, and so on. And for another, the structure of the Eskimo-Aleut languages is more conducive to producing multiple \u201cwords\u201d for snow.\n\nLinguists call languages like the Eskimo polysynthetic. In synthetic languages, words are formed from smaller semantic parts. In polysynthetic languages words get composed out of many smaller parts, sometimes truly bonkers numbers of smaller parts. This is how the Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages work: words are formed via polysynthetic suffixes.\n\nBut \u201cwords\u201d doesn\u2019t fully explain the weirdness of polysynthetic languages. The thing we call a \u201cword\u201d in English is a singular semantic and grammatical unit. Inuit languages can add as many suffixes (or postbases) as they want onto the end of a single root.

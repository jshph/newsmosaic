In the U.S., the major carriers are Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. All of them will carry the new phone, so how do you decide? We've gone over their plans and their coverage, and here are the details.\n\nEach of the big four carriers are the first out of the gate in the United States to offer the new iPhone models. And each are trying to sweeten the pot to get customers to jump at the new iPhones too. Some are giving billing credit incentives, some are offering generous trade-in allowances for working phones, and more.\n\nRegardless of which carrier you choose, the 16 GB iPhone 6 will start at $199 on contract, with $299 on contract the base price for the larger iPhone 6 Plus. Add $100 to increase either phone from 16 GB to 64 GB, and another $100 for 128 GB.\n\nOver the past year all four companies have changed the way they handle phone sales, all with an emphasis on helping you turn over your phone more quickly.\n\nFor Verizon, it's called Edge \u2014\u00a0buy an iPhone in 20 payments. After 30 days and once you've paid off 60 percent of the cost of the phone, you're eligible for an upgrade. Verizon is also giving a $200 credit if you buy a new iPhone 6 (not the 6 Plus) from them, assuming you're willing to trade in an iPhone 4 or newer and agree to a new two-year contract. They're billing this as a \"free iPhone 6.\" Not quite, but a $200 trade-in gift card may be a strong incentive for some customers.\n\nAT&T's program is called Next. It's 20 monthly payments as well, but you're not qualified to upgrade until the 12th installment. (There's a 24 month, 18th installment version available too). Once you upgrade, the cycle starts again. AT&T also incents customers to use Next by offering a $100 billing credit if you sign up. Like Verizon, AT&T's offering a trade-in credit for working phones, with a pretty generous allowance - you can get $200 for a working, unblemished iPhone 4.\n\nSprint's new program is called \"iPhone for Life,\" and it's specifically geared towards customers interested in the new iPhone models. You can get the 6 or the 6 Plus for $20 per month. And after 24 months, you can trade in your old phone for a new one. It's essentially a leasing arrangement that makes you pay out $480 for the privilege of using the phone, then turning it in when you're eligible for a new one. You can get up to $300 in credit for an eligible iPhone trade-in.\n\nT-Mobile breaks up the cost of the iPhone over 24 months, and your cost depends on your credit (with a 16 GB iPhone 6 starting at $27.08 a month). The company offers a trade-up upgrade called Jump that lets you upgrade as soon as you've paid off 50 percent of the balance of the phone. T-Mobile is also offering its customers a trade-in value guarantee: They'll meet or beat all the other major carriers' deals, and if you find a better deal within seven days, you'll get the difference back plus $50.\n\nIt's enough to make your head spin. There are a lot of different plans available from each wireless company. What you'll pay depends on how many lines you're managing and how much bandwidth you're willing to pay for, but here's a quick breakdown. I'm going to focus on each company's shared plans for now, since so much consumer attention is focused on that right now. All the plans offer unlimited domestic talk and text.\n\nVerizon's program is called \"More Everything.\" A pool of data that can be shared on up to ten devices (smartphones, tablets and so on), personal hotspot support for your iPhone, and some other perks, like cloud storage, international messaging and more. Line access for each phone costs $40, with a fee for data on top of that which varies depending on how much bandwidth you're paying for. Verizon incents its customers to enroll in its Edge program by offering them $10 off per smartphone for the More Everything plan.\n\nAT&T's variation is called Mobile Share. Just like Verizon, up to 10 devices can share a pooled data allotment. International messaging, and 50 GB of free cloud storage using AT&T's Locker service. Plan charges start at $20 per month for 300 MB of data, running up to $375 for 50 GB of data, with lots of stops in-between. Each smartphone costs $40 for line access, though you get a better price break than you do with Verizon if you're in AT&T's Next upgrade program: 6 GB or less data plans knock that line service fee down to $25 per month; 10 GB or more play only $15 per month for each smartphone line.\n\nSprint's new Family Share plan waives monthly access charges through 2015. Up to ten devices can be connected, with data plans available ranging from 1 GB per device to 6 GB per device. The company is also pushing a single-line unlimited data offer for iPhone customers for $50 per month.\n\nT-Mobile's Simple Choice plan lets you scale savings based on how many lines you need. You can pick and choose data allotments for each line, with 2.5 GB to unlimited data available. T-Mobile also offers unlimited data and text in more than 120 countries, along with music streaming that doesn't count against your data cap, and a recently announced deal that gets you Visual Voicemail and texting capabilities on board airplanes equipped with GoGo Wi-Fi.\n\nVerizon remains the dominant player in the U.S. market, with the biggest 4G LTE network and the biggest footprint. After focusing on modernizing their network over the past few years and migrating to 4G LTE, They've spent a lot of 2014 building out capacity to improve network congestion in urban areas. However, you will pay for the privilege. Verizon isn't the most competitive on price, simply because they don't have to be.\n\nOne problem that Verizon has faced with the iPhone in the past is going away: simultaneous voice and data communication; namely, that iPhones on Verizon's network couldn't do it. That's changing thanks to two factors: Verizon will soon bringing online Voice over LTE (VoLTE), voice call technology that is encoded as data instead of a dedicated radio channel, and the iPhone 6 can do VoLTE. So users in the past who were worried about not being able to access the web while they were talking, or pull up map information and so on, won't need to worry going forward.\n\nAT&T is second to Verizon in terms of customer base, but the company hasn't let that stop it from aggressively building out its 4G LTE network. AT&T boasts better reliability than the competition, with high scores from independent testers for call quality and Internet speed.\n\nWhile VoLTE will level the voice/data playing field in the future, AT&T's use of the GSM networking standard makes simultaneous voice/data communication the way things have long worked on their network, so you don't need to worry about the switch getting flipped in the future \u2014\u00a0it works now, just as it always has.\n\nSprint's been playing catchup as they build out capacity and speed on their 4G LTE network. They've tried to make up for it by offering some really good deals to sign up new customers, which makes them an attractive offer for bargain-hunting mobile users looking for the best possible deals.\n\nThere's a big glimmer of hope from the iPhone 6 - it's the first iPhone to support Sprint's \"Spark\" service, which offers faster data speeds on their network. It's something already available on some Android phones, but the iPhone 6 will be Apple's first phone to support Spark.\n\nshook up the mobile industry in the U.S. a year ago with their \"Uncarrier\" program. It seems like every month or two they're giving customers a new reason to come, whether it's eating Early Termination Fees (ETFs) for customers switching mid-contract, making music-streaming available without dinging your data allotment, free Visual Voicemail and texting on some Wi-Fi equipped airplanes, and more.\n\nThey're also aggressively building out their 4G LTE footprint and really have improved their network over the past year. They still have a long way to go before they'll catch up to AT&T, but their customer-friendly attitude and their simplified pricing plans make them an attractive choice for a growing number of mobile users.\n\nIf you're not sure which carrier to go with, pop on over to our iPhone discussion forums and chat with the fine folks there, or drop a message here and hear what others have to say.", "wordchoice": ["first", "the", "VoLTE", "will", "starting", "and", "an", "per", "iPhone", "re", "need", "an"], "title": "Verizon vs AT&T vs T-Mobile vs Sprint: Which American iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus carrier should you choose?"}, {"url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~3/1awe455sTIU/story01.htm", "corpus": "Canadian wireless carrier Rogers has confirmed that pre-orders for Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will commence at 5 AM Eastern Time on September 12, which is 2 AM Pacific Time.

Though the Apple Watch does plenty, Apple is said to be bundling even more sensors to expand the Apple Watch's health tracking capabilities in a future hardware revision.\n\n\"Two people familiar with Apple's plans told Reuters the company is planning to unveil richer health features and additional sensors in later versions, the first iteration not hitting the market until early 2015,\" Reuters reported.\n\nGiven that the Apple Watch won't be available for purchase until 2015, Apple may not have announced all of the device's features. So while we may know many of the capabilities of the Apple Watch and its design, Apple could still have a one more thing when it comes to the Apple Watch's list of features.\n\nSimilarly, Motorola did not announce the heart rate sensor nor the wireless charging feature when the Moto 360 was introduced alongside Google's Android Wear platform, with disclosures of the full capabilities of the Moto 360 coming days ahead of the watch being made available for pre-orders. Apple may likely have a few surprises still in store for the Apple Watch to keep pundits on their toes.\n\nRight now, despite the advanced capabilities of the Apple Watch, it still doesn't offer standalone sleep tracking or GPS tracking information without being tethered to an iPhone.\n\nAnd Reuters admits that Apple may purposefully be building a low-key fitness product to stay under the FDA's radar to avoid additional regulatory scrutiny. Once the Apple Watch is considered a \"health\" rather than a fitness accessory, it may be subjected to additional FDA review.\n\nWhat do you think of the Apple Watch and Apple's strategy?

We've now got LTE support across the country from all the major carriers, even some of the MVNOs are starting to get in on that and pricing is become every more competitive. Add to that increasing competition from high-street retailers to get your business and it can become a real challenge to hunt down the best deal.\n\nThat's where we come in. We've rounded up the best the major players have to offer so you don't have to!\n\nWhile last year 4G LTE was still in its relative infancy when the iPhone 5s launched, this year all the major carriers can boast significant and ever increasing coverage. With the headstart it had, EE can still boast higher download speeds and more areas covered, but they're no longer the only big player. O2, Vodafone and even Three have all started their aggressive rollouts of LTE data and various deals to lock you in to for 2-years. As with last year, calls and texts aren't really an issue anymore since most contracts offer unlimited or very high allowances of both.\n\nAt the time of writing there aren't any subsidized prices available \u2013 we'll be back with those when pre-orders have gone live \u2013 but also worth considering are some of the SIM only deals available from each of them. If you're happy to pay the full retail price for your iPhone by buying it from Apple you can save yourself some of the monthly outlay while still getting a good amount of data. Check out this next chart for a roundup of some of the best SIM only options for 4G LTE data.\n\nSomething else worth considering is Wifi calling. Introduced with iOS 8, EE has already announced its intentions to support Wifi calling. Three and O2 will also allow you to do the same, though you need to download a separate application to allow you to do it.\n\nThere are numerous smaller MVNO carriers in the UK, but the two biggest to consider are Virgin Media and GiffGaff. Both offer good signal, and good packages on a SIM only basis to prospective iPhone buyers. On GiffGaff you're looking at paying \u00a312 a month upwards for packages with unlimited data but without tethering included. Compared to the main carriers these 30-day rolling deals offer an extremely compelling package.\n\nVirgin Media offers a range of packages but as ever those who are already customers on one of the suppliers TV or broadband packages will get the best deals. As such, Virgin is probably only worth really considering if you fall into this category. Tariffs with 1GB of data and up start from just \u00a310 a month on a 30-day rolling arrangement. 2GB will cost \u00a315 and for unlimited of everything you're going to pay a pretty reasonable \u00a318 a month.\n\nThen there's coverage to take into account. After all, there's little point paying out if you're not going to be getting what you're paying for. Generally the big four all have excellent coverage nationwide, with the usual blackspots to be expected. The best thing to do is to check out the coverage maps at the links below for each of them.\n\nAnd, since two of the bigger MVNOs, Virgin and GiffGaff that we mentioned above, use EE and O2 signal respectively, check out those carriers maps for more information on those.\n\nOne of the strengths here is O2 Refresh, where the phone and the cellular connection are split apart from each other. Each incurs a cost that combines to make one monthly payment, but the net result is a potentially cheaper way to upgrade next year to the next iPhone. You won't have to buy out your whole remaining contract, just the amount you still owe on the phone, and then you get to start all over again.\n\nOn the SIM only front, O2 isn't the most expensive options and you can find a good compromise of data packages at reasonable prices should you be willing to lock in for 12 months.\n\nAnd of course, if you get great O2 signal where you are, they're worth a look.\n\nEE has more coverage than the other LTE enabled carriers so far, and has even rolled out double-speed data in certain locations such as London and Birmingham. The network that came together as a combined effort of Orange and T-Mobile has solid signal across most of the UK, and also has a decent reputation for working indoors.\n\nEE has recently shaken up its price plans a little and the biggest thing missing on a SIM only basis is a really high data cap offering as you get with most of the other UK carriers. But if you're in an area well served by EE LTE signal, particularly the double-speed, then it's certainly worth a look.\n\nAt this point, the strongest argument is that if the signal in your area is strongest on Vodafone, then go with them. Their LTE offering is improved on 12 months ago but their tariffs are still more expensive when you get towards the higher tiers of data allowance than the competition. But, Vodafone does offer higher allowances on a SIM only basis than EE, which is another point in its favour.\n\nLong serving customers and folks who enjoy the best signal are best suited to Vodafone.\n\nIf you want unlimited data, properly unlimited data, then Three is the one to beat. New customers still get unlimited mobile data but it no longer includes unlimited tethering. Only customers on an existing contract will be grandfathered in to that so if it's important to you you're probably better buying a new iPhone outright. There's a misconception that Three signal isn't great, but those days are over with the majority of the UK now covered.\n\nThree's LTE rollout is now in full swing but it's not yet covering wide areas of the UK. But its HSPA+ network offers some pretty astounding speeds as it is, with 20Mbps+ down on tap in many areas.\n\nThree is the single best choice for the truly data hungry iPhone owner.\n\nIf you can afford to buy an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus outright from an Apple Store, there's no reason not to look at one of these two. Signal is pretty great and without the phone to worry about paying for your monthly bill will be much lower than on one of the big four carriers who want to sell you the phone as well, and on a SIM only basis both are extremely competitive without requiring you to be locked into a contract for more than 30 days at a time.\n\nIf you're still not sure about which UK carrier to get for your new iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus or even if you're going to pick up a new iPhone 5s or iPhone 5c jump into our iPhone discussion forums and the best community in mobile will happily help you out.

If you're in Canada, that means the big three carriers of Rogers, Bell, and TELUS, their lower-price subsidiaries, and a few upstarts. All of the big three have confirmed that they'll be offering the latest and greatest iPhones, though none of them have nailed down pricing. Apple announced $299 on a two-year plan for the 16 GB iPhone 6 Plus, and $199 on contract for the 16 GB iPhone 6, and it's safe to assume the Canadian carriers will stay in line with that. So which carrier should you go with? We've chewed through the plans and coverage, and here's what we've found!\n\nAcross the board, we're expecting the 16 GB iPhone 6 will be $199 on contract, $299 for the 64 GB version, and $399 for the 128 GB model. The iPhone 6 Plus should start at $299 on contract for the 16 GB model, $399 on contract for the 64 GB version, and $499 on contract for the 128 GB iPhone 6 Plus.\n\nThe big three Canadian carriers all work on what's effectively a pro-rated early termination fee now. It used to be that if you cut your contract early, it was more or less a flat fee based on how many months you had left on your contract, capping out at around $400. Now the subsidy you take on your phone is factored in with how long you have left on your contract. Rogers calls this system FLEXtab, TELUS calls it Device Balance, and Bell calls it Data Service Agreement Price Adjustment.\n\nBasically, if you get $500 off the price of your $700 device, it would be about $250 to get out of your contract a year early. That $500 discount gets paid off in equal increments every month in your term (so, $500/24 = $20.83). After 12 months, you will have paid back $250 of that balance, leaving the other half to be paid off before you leave. When you're halfway through your contract, you're halfway to paying back your subsidy.\n\nMonthly rates across all three are suspiciously identical, and all Canadian carriers allow you to share your data to an iPad for another $10/month.\n\nBell and TELUS share the same towers for their GSM/LTE network but have different back-hauls (different connections to the internet from the towers). That means the Bell/TELUS tower near your home, school, or work could still provide better speeds on one or the other networks.\n\nEach of the big three carriers owns a subsidiary that typically offers lower-cost options by way of a tab system, similar to what the big three are using. Rogers owns Fido. Bell owns Virgin Mobile. TELUS owns Koodo. All three have announced they'll be carrying the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. They're great options if you want a balance of subsidized cost up-front and contract flexibility.\n\nIf you're really want an alternative, you also have the option to buy the 6 Plus unlocked starting at $749 or iPhone 6 starting at $649, and run with WIND or Mobilicity. They have great plans starting at $25. It ends up being cheaper in the long run, just keep in mind that you'll be missing out on LTE.\n\nRegion-specific carriers are also out there, like Sasktel, MTS, and Videotron. Typically they'll have roaming agreements in place if you ever leave your hometown. Decent data plans will typically start at about $50/month, which can certainly be cheaper than going with Rogers, Bell, or TELUS.\n\nRogers is the big boy on the block. Of course all of the major centers are covered with Rogers LTE, including Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary, Regina, Edmonton, and lots of others. Recent expansions include a bunch across Quebec, such as Greater Montreal Area (East), Granby, Lachute, Saguenay, Saint-Hyacinthe and Bromont. Data overages cost $15 / GB.\n\nIf you're in those areas and speed matters more to you than money, go with Rogers.\n\nFor coverage, you'll see that there are a few areas where Bell reaches that others don't, namely up north. Bell regularly boasts to having Canada's largest LTE network. When it comes to speed, Bell has the same kind of 150 Mbps LTE as Rogers in the Greater Toronto Area, Cambridge, and Kitchener-Waterloo. Data overages are $0.05/MB, which is on par with TELUS, and way more pricey than Rogers.\n\nJust looking at the coverage map, Bell is a good choice if you're in the Prairies, Maritimes, or up north.\n\nYou can see from the coverage map that the Ontario corridor is well covered by TELUS, as well as the Maritimes. Alberta's also looking pretty good, and it there's even some decent service in the Northwest Territories. TELUS network speeds peak out at around 75 Mbps, which is a little slower than Bell and Rogers at their fastest. Data overages are $5 / 100 MB for first 1500 MB, and $0.05 / MB after first 1500 MB, which is considerably more steep than Rogers' overage rate, and roughly the same as Bell.\n\nCoverage may again be a deciding factor when going with TELUS, but anecdotally, you may find their customer service a little bit better than the other two. TELUS subsidiary Koodo has ranked pretty well on that front.\n\nHere's where it gets more complicated. If you have an unlocked iPhone and are simply looking for a SIM card to place in it, you have a ton of options from Fido, Virgin Mobile, and more. If saving money is absolutely the most important thing to you, figure out the barest minimum voice, data, and extras like messaging you need, and then check out someone like Virgin Mobile. You'll get a great deal.\n\nIf you're still not sure about which Canadian carrier to get for your iPhone 6 Plus or iPhone 6, jump into our iPhone discussion forums and the best community in mobile will happily help you out.

Upgrading to the iPhone 6 will be like upgrading from an iPhone 5 to an iPhone 5S\u2014yes, it\u2019s bigger, but it\u2019s also very comfortable. It will be a very easy upgrade for most people. That said, I\u2019d be hard pressed to guess which model will be the top seller for Apple. The company has proven in the past that the inexpensive model isn\u2019t always the top seller. I think many people will be like me and need to see it in person and see how it feels. It\u2019s a departure for Apple, but one they could make work with iOS 8 and the special gestures incorporated into the software.\n\nWhile the new iPhone 6 isn\u2019t lighter than the iPhone 5, it feels incredibly thin compared to the iPhone 5s I had on hand for comparisons. In terms of the design of the device, it\u2019s clear that Apple had to break some trends that seemed to be present in previous iPhones. For one, the noticeable camera bump came from a need to maintain and/or improve camera quality while simultaneously driving down z-height overall, so there seems to have been an industrial design trade-off here for the sake of functionality. There\u2019s also the relatively thick plastic lines which are a departure from previous designs but seem to be necessary for NFC capabilities. I\u2019m personally unsure how I feel on these two design elements, but they may be an issue for some.\n\nThe back of the phones are made out of aluminum with some clearly visible cutouts made to allow wireless signals in and out. The design as a whole is more reminiscent of the 2012 iPod Touch than current iPhones, an observation that extends to the slightly protruding camera lens. You won\u2019t notice this bulge if you keep your phone in a case or sit it on a soft surface, but if you set the phone on a hard table it definitely will wobble a bit in place. Both phones feel lighter than you\u2019d expect them to\u20144.55 ounces for the 6 and 6.07 ounces for the 6 Plus, compared to 5.64 ounces for the 5-inch HTC One M8 or 5.08 ounces for the new Moto X\u2014but they still feel as sturdy as you\u2019d expect from an Apple product.\n\nIn the hand, the iPhone 6 definitely feels noticeably larger, but what\u2019s remarkable is that it doesn\u2019t feel significantly bulky. The rounded sides and thin, lightweight chassis kind of harken back to older devices, in fact, like the iPhone 3GS and earlier, but the more premium materials used here add another dimension of quality. Playing with the new camera reveals the improvements there are also impressive. The iPhone 6 gets all the new features besides optical image stabilization, including slow motion video at 240 FPS, which is two times faster than the iPhone 5s (and so two times slower when played back). The camera\u2019s autofocus is fast and effective thanks to the addition of phase detection, and it no longer highlights the point of focus, which it doesn\u2019t really need to because of its improvements.\n\nNaturally, there\u2019s going to be some hesitation by those who\u2019ve been used to the 3.5-inch or 4-inch size of all previous generations of the iPhone, but the 4.7-inch model is still reasonable enough that most users should easily get used to the new size. At 6.9mm, it\u2019s thinner than the 5s (7.6mm), and its curved sides bring a sleek look that should still be plenty comfortable for most traditional iPhone fans. I had no problem gripping the iPhone 6, and it felt right at home in my palms.\n\nAt 4.7-inches, the device doesn\u2019t feel big; the thinness might help perpetuate that illusion, or maybe it\u2019s just that we\u2019re used to from bigger devices. It\u2019s also really light, and the power button being moved to the right side is in the perfect spot. You won\u2019t have to stretch your hand up to the top just to sleep/wake your device. It looks like a major step up from the iPhone 5s, and we know how much Apple fans loved that design.\n\nWhen you are done reading the early first impressions, you can voice your opinion on the iPhone 6 in the comments.

Despite rumors that had placed it launching in mid-2014, it looks like Apple is now planning a mid-2015 launch of the new MacBook. Previous rumors had suggested that, if not in mid-2014, then late in the same year, or early 2015. The report also claims, which is quite new for this sort of thing, that Apple is planning to launch the new laptop in not only a silver and space gray option, but also gold.\n\nThis would match the color scheme offered by the iPhone lineup (iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus).\n\n\u201cThe most fascinating part of this report is that Apple is also planning to change the colours for the first time with an Aluminium MacBook, the source says that Apple is planning to add Space Grey and Gold colours to their MacBook lineup, which would be consistent with the colours on the iPhone 6.\u201c\n\nWhat\u2019s even more interesting, is that MacRumors believes this report actually has merit, and that Apple could indeed be planning to launch \u201cspecial edition\u201d 12-inch MacBooks in 2015.

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have a whole bunch of new features, including a larger display, a better camera, a faster processor, a longer battery life and more. If you\u2019ve completed your contract, the iPhone 6 starts at $199 and the iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299, both for the 16GB model with 64GB, and 128GB configurations available as well.\n\nShould you upgrade to iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus from your current iPhone\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided you want to upgrade, the next question is\u00a0\u201cWhich iPhone 6 variant do you choose?\u201d The iPhone lineup had just one top-of-the-line model earlier, but this time there are two flagship models, the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus.\n\niPhone 6 vs iPhone 6 Plus: Does size really matter?\n\nIf you are considering switching carriers and finding the best plan for you based on cost and what each package includes in terms of talk, text and data, we\u2019ve done the homework for you and prepared a guide:\n\nAT&T vs. Verizon vs. Sprint vs. T-Mobile: Which iPhone 6 carrier to choose based on cost\n\nThe next step is deciding which storage capacity to buy. Apple changed the storage configurations with the iPhone 6. While the lineup starts at 16GB, the next model isn\u2019t 32GB, it\u2019s 64GB, and the top storage capacity is 128GB. The choice here is heavily dependant on your usage patterns. If you use a lot of cloud storage and streaming services, then you\u2019ll likely be ok with the 16GB model. If you shoot a lot of photos and videos or like playing heavy games, then you might want to go with the 64GB or 128GB option.\n\n16GB, 64GB or 128GB \u2014 Which iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus storage capacity should you buy\n\nThe iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus come in three colors:\u00a0Space Gray, Gold and Silver.

There are several protection plans and insurance plans available for the iPhone, that cover your costs if the iPhone suffers accidental damage. These include AppleCare+, SquareTrade, Credit Card warranties and more, and we walk you through each of the options in the post linked below.\n\niPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus Insurance: AppleCare vs. Other Warranties\n\nWhere to sell your current iPhone\n\nYou can sell your current iPhone through a number of ways and use the extra cash towards your iPhone 6 purchase. There are a number of websites like NextWorth, Gazelle that specialise in dealing with used gadgets, but you can also sell it via eBay or Craigslist. Many carriers and retailers, including Apple, have their own trade-in program, where you can get store credit or discounts when you bring in your old iPhone.\n\nBest Places to sell your used iPhone to buy the iPhone 6\n\nWill you be preordering the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus? Let us know in the comments below.", "wordchoice": ["iPhone", "Best", "you", "camera", "and", "use", "iPhone", "sell", "cost", "through", "then", "done"], "title": "iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus Buyers Guide"}, {"url": "http://feeds.iphonehacks.com/~r/iphonehacks/~3/rRPRCJcnLas/iphone-6-applecare-vs-other-warranties.html", "corpus": "If you are planning on purchasing the new iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus when they are available later this month, it would probably be wise to consider the various insurance options available to protect your expensive purchase. In this column, join us as we do a side-by-side comparison of AppleCare with other warranty plans available.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about something that a lot of people might not realize off the top: when you purchase an iPhone 6 or any Apple device, it is automatically covered under a one-year limited warranty for no additional cost. It doesn\u2019t matter if you purchased the device directly from Apple, or through Amazon, Best Buy or any Apple authorized reseller.\n\nAs this warranty plan is cost free, you can probably imagine that it is fairly limited in scope. Essentially, the only two things that are covered are the iPhone 6\u2019s hardware and any consumable parts \u2014 in other words, the battery \u2014 if they are damaged or dysfunctional due to a manufacturing defect. Plus, 90 days of complimentary phone support.\n\nFortunately, a few years ago, AppleCare+ was introduced. This warranty plan, which has supplemented\u00a0the standard AppleCare in most countries,\u00a0expands your coverage areas, provides you with more customer service options and covers accidental damage under certain conditions.\n\nAppleCare+ doubles\u00a0your one-year limited warranty plan\u00a0to two years from the original purchase date of the device, in addition to extending\u00a0your complimentary phone support from 90 days to 2 years. You must purchase this plan within 60 days purchasing your iPhone 6 and provide that your device is undamaged and in proper working order.\n\nAppleCare+ will set you back a one-time payment of $99 if you are purchasing the warranty plan for an iPhone 6. That might sound like an unnecessary additional cost, but the good thing about AppleCare+ is that it covers up to two incidents of accidental damage for a $79 service fee.\u00a0In most cases, that\u2019s a lot cheaper than fixing your iPhone yourself.\n\nImagine this: it is a hot summer day and you are ready to go swimming in your friend\u2019s pool in his or her backyard. You\u2019re excited to escape the heat and cool off in the water, get your bathing suit on and jump right in. A few seconds later, you realize that your iPhone was in your pocket. Frantically, you get out of the pool and assess the damage.\n\nA quick Google search has told you to put the soaked iPhone in a bowl of rice to dry out, but it is of little use. Your iPhone is dead.\u00a0Accidents happen, and that\u2019s where AppleCare+ can save your behind for a fraction of the cost that Apple authorized service would cost.\n\nIn addition to covering accidental physical or water damage, AppleCare+ will also replace your defective or broken iPhone headphones or Lightning cable and a battery that has depleted by more than 50 percent within your warranty coverage period. What\u2019s not covered includes a lost or stolen device, normal wear and tear and software problems.\n\nApple also specifically outlines that jailbroken devices are not eligible for AppleCare+ coverage, since modifying your device in that manner is a violation of the company\u2019s End User License Agreement (EULA). However, a quick restore\u00a0of the device to factory settings through iTunes should\u00a0remove all traces of jailbreaking.\n\nAppleCare+ applies internationally and is transferrable, meaning that if you purchase a used device still covered by the warranty plan, it remains in effect until its normal expiration date.\n\nIf you are a Visa, MasterCard, American Express or other credit card holder, be sure to consult one of these companies to see what kind of warranty coverage they might offer. In a lot of cases, you might be surprised to find out you are automatically covered for free or substantially less than a lot of third-party warranty plans cost.\n\nFor instance, based on personal knowledge, the RBC Visa in Canada has an Extended Warranty Insurance that is offered to all cardholders and doubles your manufacturer\u2019s warranty \u2014 in this case, the one-year limited warranty on an iPhone 6 \u2014 from the date the manufacturer\u2019s warranty expires. The policy applies for a maximum of five years.\n\nBefore you explore any other third-party warranties available, be sure to consult your credit card company for further information. A quick online search will usually yield information about your card issuer\u2019s warranty options.\n\nYou have done your homework on credit card warranties and want to explore various third-party electronics warranty providers. Enter SquareTrade, which offers an iPhone protection plan that costs $5 per month, $99 for two years or $129 for three years and covers drops, spills and malfunctions for a $75 deductible.\n\nThe $99 upfront cost of SquareTrade is cheaper than insurance plans available through AT&T, Verizon, Sprint or Best Buy, and the $75 deductible is four dollars cheaper than what AppleCare+ charges. It\u2019s important to note that, just as is the case with AppleCare, loss or theft of your iPhone is not covered.\n\nSquareTrade\u2019s protection plan includes reimbursement for any Genius Bar repairs, same day repair at any local service shop and next-day replacement. The repairs that are reimbursed include a cracked screen, camera failure, battery failure, liquid damage, charging port failure, touchscreen malfunction, headphone jack problems and more.\n\nIt is highly recommended that you do not invest the money into a carrier or retailer insurance plan, as these warranties are often outsourced to third-party companies and charge exorbitant deductibles or monthly charges. For instance, paying a $10 monthly fee and $200 or so deductible through AT&T quickly adds up and makes it not worthwhile.\n\nInstead of shelling out additional money to AT&T, Verizon, Sprint or Best Buy, which the chart above shows clearly aren\u2019t the cheapest options, you are probably much better off considering AppleCare+ or SquareTrade.\n\nOverall, choosing a warranty plan will depend on how much you are willing to spend, how well you take care of your iPhone and what is available in your area. A good starting point would be to purchase a durable case and screen protector for your iPhone, as drops and water damage are two common causes of broken devices.\n\nIs your iPhone covered by a warranty plan?", "wordchoice": ["for", "reimbursed", "applies", "heat", "6", "cheapest", "until", "this", "with", "limited", "retailer", "off"], "title": "iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus Insurance"}, {"url": "http://feeds.iphonehacks.com/~r/iphonehacks/~3/Oif3LviCoLE/apple-will-reportedly-offer-store-pickup-option-iphone-6-preorders.html", "corpus": "The iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus will go on sale in stores beginning September 19, but before then it will be available for preorder beginning September 12 for major wireless carriers at 12:01 AM PST.

If our recent poll is any indication, it seems that almost twice as many people will pre-order the phone rather than wait in line next Friday to buy it directly from an Apple Store or one of the authorized retailers.\n\nPre-ordering has both its advantages and its drawbacks, so you should carefully weight your options before making a decision. To help you out, we\u2019ve created this survival guide to pre-ordering your iPhone 6 where we share some simple tips on how to prepare for tonight.\n\nWhy would you want to pre-order in the first place? While some of us have good excuses such as having to show up at work on time, the main benefit of pre-ordering is that you won\u2019t have to wait for several hours in line when the iPhone 6 becomes available in stores on September 19. If your pre-order goes through, you\u2019re assured to secure a device which will be delivered to you on September 19.\n\nThat is of course if you\u2019re able to pre-order on time. It is not unusual to see pre-order delivery times fall from the actual launch date to several days. Typically, if your pre-order goes through within a few hours of the kick off time, you\u2019re likely to receive your device on September 19. If you wait too long, you risk to see that delivery time pushed back. Time is of the essence, so the sooner you can place this pre-order, the better your chances.\n\nNo matter what happens, you\u2019ll know when you will receive your device as pre-order confirmations always show an estimated delivery date, which is fairly accurate.\n\nAssuming you\u2019re able to pre-order and get confirmation that you will receive your device on September 19, you\u2019ll have to make sure that you\u2019re home to receive the package from FedEx or UPS, or that you sign up a waiver allowing the carrier to leave the package at your door if you\u2019re not present to sign. When your iPhone ships, you will receive a tracking number with instructions on how to let the delivery guy know it is ok for him to leave the package at your door.\n\nPre-ordering and having your iPhone shipped to you is all great, but from my experience, it\u2019s also been pretty nerve wracking and frustrating. I used to pre-order my devices because of the convenience, but because my area is last on the delivery route, I would always get my package at the end of the day, making me wait all day for the precious device to arrive. First world problems, you might say, rightfully so. Still, I specifically remember the year the iPhone 5 launched. I walked by my local AT&T store and realized only a handful of people were in line. I could have lined up with everybody else and most likely get my phone in an hour or so. But because I had pre-ordered, I had to go back home and wait for FedEx to come. The FedEx guy didn\u2019t show up until 4pm that day. Since that day, I have said no to pre-orders.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to convince you pre-ordering is not a good option. I\u2019m merely trying to warn you it has some downsides too. If you decide to go ahead and pre-order, then read on for more tips.\n\nBefore you get too excited about pre-ordering your iPhone 6, you have to make sure you find out what price you\u2019re going to pay for it. If you bought your previous iPhone (or other smartphone) two years ago, then you are eligible for an upgrade. If you bought last year\u2019s iPhone 5s, then you\u2019re probably not eligible for an upgrade. Either way, you want to make sure what your status is before tonight so that there is no surprise when time comes to pre-order.\n\nEarlier today, we published a short guide on how to check your iPhone upgrade eligibility where we highlight several options for you to check your status. Unless you\u2019re positive you\u2019re eligible for an upgrade, I\u2019d advise you to check it out to make sure what your options are comes midnight tonight.\n\nThe pre-ordering start time is a pretty hectic time and you don\u2019t want to waste precious seconds figuring out what model, what finish, and what storage option you want. If you\u2019re going to be pre-ordering your device tonight, you must figure out all the details of your pre-order now. It means you must make up your mind about either getting the iPhone 6, or iPhone 6 Plus. You must make a decision about the finish of the device, and finally, you must make sure you know exactly how much storage space you want for your iPhone.\n\nIt sounds like a non-issue, but again, you don\u2019t want to waste time weighting your options when pre-orders go live. When they go live, you must be ready to click as quick as possible to select what you want and wrap up your order. Remember, a few seconds can make a big difference in the end, and those 30 seconds you took to decide between silver or gold could mean you will receive your iPhone 6 on September 22 instead of September 19.\n\nDepending on your sleeping habits and where you live, you\u2019ll have two options when it comes to making sure you\u2019re behind your computer at 12.01 am PT tonight. You can either decide to stay awake, or go to sleep for a few hours and set an alarm to ring a few minutes before the T time.\n\nI live in California, so in previous years, I would simply stay up until midnight and go to bed once I had pre-ordered. But if you live on the East coast for example, 12.01am PT is 3.01am ET for you. It might be a little hard to stay up that late (again, it also depends on your sleeping habits). If that\u2019s the case, I would definitely decide to go to bed, set an alarm for 15 minutes before pre-orders start, and get up then.\n\nOnce again, only you can make that decision. If you\u2019re anything like me, also keep in mind that the excitement of the pre-order launch might actually prevent you from sleeping anyway.\n\nAs previously mentioned, pre-orders will go live at 12.01 am PT. That\u2019s 2.01 am CT, and 3.01 am ET.\n\nAs far as we know, only Apple and carriers are taking pre-orders for the iPhone 6 at this time. Although Best Buy, RadioShack, Walmart, and other retailers are authorized Apple retailers, there is no indication on these companies\u2019 website that they will be taking pre-orders. Target, who\u2019s also an authorized retailer notes on its website that pre-orders will be available \u201cin stores\u201d on September 12. This means you won\u2019t be able to pre-order from Target\u2019s website, but you\u2019ll be able to pre-order from a physical store.\n\nThis leaves us with only a few options to pre-order: Apple, or the carriers.\n\nGoing through Apple\u2019s site is a no brainer for most people. After all, who better than the maker of the iPhone itself can better serve you? And that\u2019s mostly right. The experience of pre-ordering a device on Apple\u2019s website is much better than that of a carrier\u2019s site. However, from previous experience, I\u2019ve found that Apple\u2019s site gets slammed with so much traffic that it can make it for a terrible experience too, with pages taking forever to load, or simply returning errors. While this was more true a few years ago than it is today, pre-ordering a device from Apple\u2019s site from day one can prove to be a rocky road.\n\nIn the past, when Apple\u2019s site was buried under massive amounts of traffic, I\u2019ve found AT&T\u2019s site to be more reliable. If I was to pre-order tonight, I would most likely go through AT&T. Fanboys might scream \u201cblasphemy,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is getting your pre-order in as quick and as reliably as possible.\n\nFor your convenience, here is where you can pre-order your iPhone from tonight:\n\nIt appears that pre-ordering via Apple\u2019s website will give you the option to pick up your device in store on September 19. Although most stores might not participate, you will see an option to pick up your device in an Apple Store at the time of your pre-order. That could be a definite plus, compared to waiting for the FedEx guy. But keep in mind that you likely won\u2019t be the only one having chose this option, and you\u2019ll probably have to wait in line to get your device anyway.\n\nI clearly remember last time I pre-ordered an iPhone. I was frenetically refreshing my browser, waiting for the pre-order screen to go live, when all the sudden, I saw a river of tweets telling pre-orders were live. A bunch of refreshes later, and I was still not seeing the pre-order screen. As it turned out, my browser had cached the web page and was serving me page that was a few minutes old. I could have cleared the cache, but I decided that opening a different browser would probably be quicker. I launched Chrome and went with my pre-order. These were a few seconds that I could have saved. It didn\u2019t have an impact of the final pre-order, but it could have, so be prepared.\n\nMy advice is to use your main browser, and if things don\u2019t show on time, try launching a different browser as I did.\n\nOne of the most annoying things about buying online is that you have to fill out forms. Fill in your name, address, email, credit card number, expiration date, security code, etc\u2026 This is something that Apple Pay will most definitely fix in the future, but unfortunately we aren\u2019t there quite yet, which is why you must be prepared.\n\nI personally use TextExpander where I created dozens of shortcuts for my personal information and my credit cards details. This way, when I buy something online, I can fill out the forms more quickly than I would if I had to type it all in. Typing a credit card number can be tedious, so be ready.\n\nIf you don\u2019t use TextExpander, what you can do is open a text editor and type in your details prior to the pre-order launch. This way, you could quickly copy/paste some of your information\u00a0 (ie. credit card number) without losing too much time. Once again, every second counts!\n\nNow that you are ready for tonight, it is time to sit back and relax. However you decide to place your pre-order, you are now equipped for the T time.\n\nBefore the pre-orders go live, make sure to keep a close look on Twitter, because you never know what can happen. A few years ago, pre-orders accidentally went live a few minutes before the scheduled time. It was a nice surprise indeed, and those who were keeping a close eye to their Twitter stream were able to rip the benefits of it, with their pre-orders going through before everybody else.\n\nBecause Apple and carriers have been having issues with pre-orders in the past, I assume that they have worked out many of the reasons why sites would crash or return errors due to heavy traffic. I\u2019m confident that this year will be the smoothest pre-order launch to date. See what I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m being positive here because stressing out won\u2019t change a thing.\n\nYippee! Your pre-order went through. Congratulations. Now it\u2019s time to go to bed. I know it\u2019s hard because your head and belly are filled with excitement, but it will wear off.\n\nIf you are pre-ordering your iPhone, please make sure to come by iDB and share your experience with us.

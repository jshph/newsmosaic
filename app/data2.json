In the U.S., the major carriers are Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. All of them will carry the new phone, so how do you decide? We've gone over their plans and their coverage, and here are the details.\n\nEach of the big four carriers are the first out of the gate in the United States to offer the new iPhone models. And each are trying to sweeten the pot to get customers to jump at the new iPhones too. Some are giving billing credit incentives, some are offering generous trade-in allowances for working phones, and more.\n\nRegardless of which carrier you choose, the 16 GB iPhone 6 will start at $199 on contract, with $299 on contract the base price for the larger iPhone 6 Plus. Add $100 to increase either phone from 16 GB to 64 GB, and another $100 for 128 GB.\n\nOver the past year all four companies have changed the way they handle phone sales, all with an emphasis on helping you turn over your phone more quickly.\n\nFor Verizon, it's called Edge \u2014\u00a0buy an iPhone in 20 payments. After 30 days and once you've paid off 60 percent of the cost of the phone, you're eligible for an upgrade. Verizon is also giving a $200 credit if you buy a new iPhone 6 (not the 6 Plus) from them, assuming you're willing to trade in an iPhone 4 or newer and agree to a new two-year contract. They're billing this as a \"free iPhone 6.\" Not quite, but a $200 trade-in gift card may be a strong incentive for some customers.\n\nAT&T's program is called Next. It's 20 monthly payments as well, but you're not qualified to upgrade until the 12th installment. (There's a 24 month, 18th installment version available too). Once you upgrade, the cycle starts again. AT&T also incents customers to use Next by offering a $100 billing credit if you sign up. Like Verizon, AT&T's offering a trade-in credit for working phones, with a pretty generous allowance - you can get $200 for a working, unblemished iPhone 4.\n\nSprint's new program is called \"iPhone for Life,\" and it's specifically geared towards customers interested in the new iPhone models. You can get the 6 or the 6 Plus for $20 per month. And after 24 months, you can trade in your old phone for a new one. It's essentially a leasing arrangement that makes you pay out $480 for the privilege of using the phone, then turning it in when you're eligible for a new one. You can get up to $300 in credit for an eligible iPhone trade-in.\n\nT-Mobile breaks up the cost of the iPhone over 24 months, and your cost depends on your credit (with a 16 GB iPhone 6 starting at $27.08 a month). The company offers a trade-up upgrade called Jump that lets you upgrade as soon as you've paid off 50 percent of the balance of the phone. T-Mobile is also offering its customers a trade-in value guarantee: They'll meet or beat all the other major carriers' deals, and if you find a better deal within seven days, you'll get the difference back plus $50.\n\nIt's enough to make your head spin. There are a lot of different plans available from each wireless company. What you'll pay depends on how many lines you're managing and how much bandwidth you're willing to pay for, but here's a quick breakdown. I'm going to focus on each company's shared plans for now, since so much consumer attention is focused on that right now. All the plans offer unlimited domestic talk and text.\n\nVerizon's program is called \"More Everything.\" A pool of data that can be shared on up to ten devices (smartphones, tablets and so on), personal hotspot support for your iPhone, and some other perks, like cloud storage, international messaging and more. Line access for each phone costs $40, with a fee for data on top of that which varies depending on how much bandwidth you're paying for. Verizon incents its customers to enroll in its Edge program by offering them $10 off per smartphone for the More Everything plan.\n\nAT&T's variation is called Mobile Share. Just like Verizon, up to 10 devices can share a pooled data allotment. International messaging, and 50 GB of free cloud storage using AT&T's Locker service. Plan charges start at $20 per month for 300 MB of data, running up to $375 for 50 GB of data, with lots of stops in-between. Each smartphone costs $40 for line access, though you get a better price break than you do with Verizon if you're in AT&T's Next upgrade program: 6 GB or less data plans knock that line service fee down to $25 per month; 10 GB or more play only $15 per month for each smartphone line.\n\nSprint's new Family Share plan waives monthly access charges through 2015. Up to ten devices can be connected, with data plans available ranging from 1 GB per device to 6 GB per device. The company is also pushing a single-line unlimited data offer for iPhone customers for $50 per month.\n\nT-Mobile's Simple Choice plan lets you scale savings based on how many lines you need. You can pick and choose data allotments for each line, with 2.5 GB to unlimited data available. T-Mobile also offers unlimited data and text in more than 120 countries, along with music streaming that doesn't count against your data cap, and a recently announced deal that gets you Visual Voicemail and texting capabilities on board airplanes equipped with GoGo Wi-Fi.\n\nVerizon remains the dominant player in the U.S. market, with the biggest 4G LTE network and the biggest footprint. After focusing on modernizing their network over the past few years and migrating to 4G LTE, They've spent a lot of 2014 building out capacity to improve network congestion in urban areas. However, you will pay for the privilege. Verizon isn't the most competitive on price, simply because they don't have to be.\n\nOne problem that Verizon has faced with the iPhone in the past is going away: simultaneous voice and data communication; namely, that iPhones on Verizon's network couldn't do it. That's changing thanks to two factors: Verizon will soon bringing online Voice over LTE (VoLTE), voice call technology that is encoded as data instead of a dedicated radio channel, and the iPhone 6 can do VoLTE. So users in the past who were worried about not being able to access the web while they were talking, or pull up map information and so on, won't need to worry going forward.\n\nAT&T is second to Verizon in terms of customer base, but the company hasn't let that stop it from aggressively building out its 4G LTE network. AT&T boasts better reliability than the competition, with high scores from independent testers for call quality and Internet speed.\n\nWhile VoLTE will level the voice/data playing field in the future, AT&T's use of the GSM networking standard makes simultaneous voice/data communication the way things have long worked on their network, so you don't need to worry about the switch getting flipped in the future \u2014\u00a0it works now, just as it always has.\n\nSprint's been playing catchup as they build out capacity and speed on their 4G LTE network. They've tried to make up for it by offering some really good deals to sign up new customers, which makes them an attractive offer for bargain-hunting mobile users looking for the best possible deals.\n\nThere's a big glimmer of hope from the iPhone 6 - it's the first iPhone to support Sprint's \"Spark\" service, which offers faster data speeds on their network. It's something already available on some Android phones, but the iPhone 6 will be Apple's first phone to support Spark.\n\nshook up the mobile industry in the U.S. a year ago with their \"Uncarrier\" program. It seems like every month or two they're giving customers a new reason to come, whether it's eating Early Termination Fees (ETFs) for customers switching mid-contract, making music-streaming available without dinging your data allotment, free Visual Voicemail and texting on some Wi-Fi equipped airplanes, and more.\n\nThey're also aggressively building out their 4G LTE footprint and really have improved their network over the past year. They still have a long way to go before they'll catch up to AT&T, but their customer-friendly attitude and their simplified pricing plans make them an attractive choice for a growing number of mobile users.\n\nIf you're not sure which carrier to go with, pop on over to our iPhone discussion forums and chat with the fine folks there, or drop a message here and hear what others have to say.", "wordchoice": ["to", "offering", "re", "that", "GB", "GB", "line", "data", "makes", "the", "technology", "generous"], "title": "Verizon vs AT&T vs T-Mobile vs Sprint: Which American iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus carrier should you choose?"}, {"url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~3/1awe455sTIU/story01.htm", "corpus": "Canadian wireless carrier Rogers has confirmed that pre-orders for Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will commence at 5 AM Eastern Time on September 12, which is 2 AM Pacific Time.

Though the Apple Watch does plenty, Apple is said to be bundling even more sensors to expand the Apple Watch's health tracking capabilities in a future hardware revision.\n\n\"Two people familiar with Apple's plans told Reuters the company is planning to unveil richer health features and additional sensors in later versions, the first iteration not hitting the market until early 2015,\" Reuters reported.\n\nGiven that the Apple Watch won't be available for purchase until 2015, Apple may not have announced all of the device's features. So while we may know many of the capabilities of the Apple Watch and its design, Apple could still have a one more thing when it comes to the Apple Watch's list of features.\n\nSimilarly, Motorola did not announce the heart rate sensor nor the wireless charging feature when the Moto 360 was introduced alongside Google's Android Wear platform, with disclosures of the full capabilities of the Moto 360 coming days ahead of the watch being made available for pre-orders. Apple may likely have a few surprises still in store for the Apple Watch to keep pundits on their toes.\n\nRight now, despite the advanced capabilities of the Apple Watch, it still doesn't offer standalone sleep tracking or GPS tracking information without being tethered to an iPhone.\n\nAnd Reuters admits that Apple may purposefully be building a low-key fitness product to stay under the FDA's radar to avoid additional regulatory scrutiny. Once the Apple Watch is considered a \"health\" rather than a fitness accessory, it may be subjected to additional FDA review.\n\nWhat do you think of the Apple Watch and Apple's strategy?

We've now got LTE support across the country from all the major carriers, even some of the MVNOs are starting to get in on that and pricing is become every more competitive. Add to that increasing competition from high-street retailers to get your business and it can become a real challenge to hunt down the best deal.\n\nThat's where we come in. We've rounded up the best the major players have to offer so you don't have to!\n\nWhile last year 4G LTE was still in its relative infancy when the iPhone 5s launched, this year all the major carriers can boast significant and ever increasing coverage. With the headstart it had, EE can still boast higher download speeds and more areas covered, but they're no longer the only big player. O2, Vodafone and even Three have all started their aggressive rollouts of LTE data and various deals to lock you in to for 2-years. As with last year, calls and texts aren't really an issue anymore since most contracts offer unlimited or very high allowances of both.\n\nAt the time of writing there aren't any subsidized prices available \u2013 we'll be back with those when pre-orders have gone live \u2013 but also worth considering are some of the SIM only deals available from each of them. If you're happy to pay the full retail price for your iPhone by buying it from Apple you can save yourself some of the monthly outlay while still getting a good amount of data. Check out this next chart for a roundup of some of the best SIM only options for 4G LTE data.\n\nSomething else worth considering is Wifi calling. Introduced with iOS 8, EE has already announced its intentions to support Wifi calling. Three and O2 will also allow you to do the same, though you need to download a separate application to allow you to do it.\n\nThere are numerous smaller MVNO carriers in the UK, but the two biggest to consider are Virgin Media and GiffGaff. Both offer good signal, and good packages on a SIM only basis to prospective iPhone buyers. On GiffGaff you're looking at paying \u00a312 a month upwards for packages with unlimited data but without tethering included. Compared to the main carriers these 30-day rolling deals offer an extremely compelling package.\n\nVirgin Media offers a range of packages but as ever those who are already customers on one of the suppliers TV or broadband packages will get the best deals. As such, Virgin is probably only worth really considering if you fall into this category. Tariffs with 1GB of data and up start from just \u00a310 a month on a 30-day rolling arrangement. 2GB will cost \u00a315 and for unlimited of everything you're going to pay a pretty reasonable \u00a318 a month.\n\nThen there's coverage to take into account. After all, there's little point paying out if you're not going to be getting what you're paying for. Generally the big four all have excellent coverage nationwide, with the usual blackspots to be expected. The best thing to do is to check out the coverage maps at the links below for each of them.\n\nAnd, since two of the bigger MVNOs, Virgin and GiffGaff that we mentioned above, use EE and O2 signal respectively, check out those carriers maps for more information on those.\n\nOne of the strengths here is O2 Refresh, where the phone and the cellular connection are split apart from each other. Each incurs a cost that combines to make one monthly payment, but the net result is a potentially cheaper way to upgrade next year to the next iPhone. You won't have to buy out your whole remaining contract, just the amount you still owe on the phone, and then you get to start all over again.\n\nOn the SIM only front, O2 isn't the most expensive options and you can find a good compromise of data packages at reasonable prices should you be willing to lock in for 12 months.\n\nAnd of course, if you get great O2 signal where you are, they're worth a look.\n\nEE has more coverage than the other LTE enabled carriers so far, and has even rolled out double-speed data in certain locations such as London and Birmingham. The network that came together as a combined effort of Orange and T-Mobile has solid signal across most of the UK, and also has a decent reputation for working indoors.\n\nEE has recently shaken up its price plans a little and the biggest thing missing on a SIM only basis is a really high data cap offering as you get with most of the other UK carriers. But if you're in an area well served by EE LTE signal, particularly the double-speed, then it's certainly worth a look.\n\nAt this point, the strongest argument is that if the signal in your area is strongest on Vodafone, then go with them. Their LTE offering is improved on 12 months ago but their tariffs are still more expensive when you get towards the higher tiers of data allowance than the competition. But, Vodafone does offer higher allowances on a SIM only basis than EE, which is another point in its favour.\n\nLong serving customers and folks who enjoy the best signal are best suited to Vodafone.\n\nIf you want unlimited data, properly unlimited data, then Three is the one to beat. New customers still get unlimited mobile data but it no longer includes unlimited tethering. Only customers on an existing contract will be grandfathered in to that so if it's important to you you're probably better buying a new iPhone outright. There's a misconception that Three signal isn't great, but those days are over with the majority of the UK now covered.\n\nThree's LTE rollout is now in full swing but it's not yet covering wide areas of the UK. But its HSPA+ network offers some pretty astounding speeds as it is, with 20Mbps+ down on tap in many areas.\n\nThree is the single best choice for the truly data hungry iPhone owner.\n\nIf you can afford to buy an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus outright from an Apple Store, there's no reason not to look at one of these two. Signal is pretty great and without the phone to worry about paying for your monthly bill will be much lower than on one of the big four carriers who want to sell you the phone as well, and on a SIM only basis both are extremely competitive without requiring you to be locked into a contract for more than 30 days at a time.\n\nIf you're still not sure about which UK carrier to get for your new iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus or even if you're going to pick up a new iPhone 5s or iPhone 5c jump into our iPhone discussion forums and the best community in mobile will happily help you out.

If you're in Canada, that means the big three carriers of Rogers, Bell, and TELUS, their lower-price subsidiaries, and a few upstarts. All of the big three have confirmed that they'll be offering the latest and greatest iPhones, though none of them have nailed down pricing. Apple announced $299 on a two-year plan for the 16 GB iPhone 6 Plus, and $199 on contract for the 16 GB iPhone 6, and it's safe to assume the Canadian carriers will stay in line with that. So which carrier should you go with? We've chewed through the plans and coverage, and here's what we've found!\n\nAcross the board, we're expecting the 16 GB iPhone 6 will be $199 on contract, $299 for the 64 GB version, and $399 for the 128 GB model. The iPhone 6 Plus should start at $299 on contract for the 16 GB model, $399 on contract for the 64 GB version, and $499 on contract for the 128 GB iPhone 6 Plus.\n\nThe big three Canadian carriers all work on what's effectively a pro-rated early termination fee now. It used to be that if you cut your contract early, it was more or less a flat fee based on how many months you had left on your contract, capping out at around $400. Now the subsidy you take on your phone is factored in with how long you have left on your contract. Rogers calls this system FLEXtab, TELUS calls it Device Balance, and Bell calls it Data Service Agreement Price Adjustment.\n\nBasically, if you get $500 off the price of your $700 device, it would be about $250 to get out of your contract a year early. That $500 discount gets paid off in equal increments every month in your term (so, $500/24 = $20.83). After 12 months, you will have paid back $250 of that balance, leaving the other half to be paid off before you leave. When you're halfway through your contract, you're halfway to paying back your subsidy.\n\nMonthly rates across all three are suspiciously identical, and all Canadian carriers allow you to share your data to an iPad for another $10/month.\n\nBell and TELUS share the same towers for their GSM/LTE network but have different back-hauls (different connections to the internet from the towers). That means the Bell/TELUS tower near your home, school, or work could still provide better speeds on one or the other networks.\n\nEach of the big three carriers owns a subsidiary that typically offers lower-cost options by way of a tab system, similar to what the big three are using. Rogers owns Fido. Bell owns Virgin Mobile. TELUS owns Koodo. All three have announced they'll be carrying the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. They're great options if you want a balance of subsidized cost up-front and contract flexibility.\n\nIf you're really want an alternative, you also have the option to buy the 6 Plus unlocked starting at $749 or iPhone 6 starting at $649, and run with WIND or Mobilicity. They have great plans starting at $25. It ends up being cheaper in the long run, just keep in mind that you'll be missing out on LTE.\n\nRegion-specific carriers are also out there, like Sasktel, MTS, and Videotron. Typically they'll have roaming agreements in place if you ever leave your hometown. Decent data plans will typically start at about $50/month, which can certainly be cheaper than going with Rogers, Bell, or TELUS.\n\nRogers is the big boy on the block. Of course all of the major centers are covered with Rogers LTE, including Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary, Regina, Edmonton, and lots of others. Recent expansions include a bunch across Quebec, such as Greater Montreal Area (East), Granby, Lachute, Saguenay, Saint-Hyacinthe and Bromont. Data overages cost $15 / GB.\n\nIf you're in those areas and speed matters more to you than money, go with Rogers.\n\nFor coverage, you'll see that there are a few areas where Bell reaches that others don't, namely up north. Bell regularly boasts to having Canada's largest LTE network. When it comes to speed, Bell has the same kind of 150 Mbps LTE as Rogers in the Greater Toronto Area, Cambridge, and Kitchener-Waterloo. Data overages are $0.05/MB, which is on par with TELUS, and way more pricey than Rogers.\n\nJust looking at the coverage map, Bell is a good choice if you're in the Prairies, Maritimes, or up north.\n\nYou can see from the coverage map that the Ontario corridor is well covered by TELUS, as well as the Maritimes. Alberta's also looking pretty good, and it there's even some decent service in the Northwest Territories. TELUS network speeds peak out at around 75 Mbps, which is a little slower than Bell and Rogers at their fastest. Data overages are $5 / 100 MB for first 1500 MB, and $0.05 / MB after first 1500 MB, which is considerably more steep than Rogers' overage rate, and roughly the same as Bell.\n\nCoverage may again be a deciding factor when going with TELUS, but anecdotally, you may find their customer service a little bit better than the other two. TELUS subsidiary Koodo has ranked pretty well on that front.\n\nHere's where it gets more complicated. If you have an unlocked iPhone and are simply looking for a SIM card to place in it, you have a ton of options from Fido, Virgin Mobile, and more. If saving money is absolutely the most important thing to you, figure out the barest minimum voice, data, and extras like messaging you need, and then check out someone like Virgin Mobile. You'll get a great deal.\n\nIf you're still not sure about which Canadian carrier to get for your iPhone 6 Plus or iPhone 6, jump into our iPhone discussion forums and the best community in mobile will happily help you out.

Read on to find out what they have to say about it.\n\nBecause they only had a short time with the device, these first impressions focus on a small part of the package. Some offer comments on the performance based on observation and not benchmarks. The real reviews will come when the phone lands in the hands of reviewers and they get some quality time with device.\n\nFor people not interested in the larger iPhone 6 Plus, there is the iPhone 6. I have absolutely no concerns about the iPhone 6 and its larger screen. It fit comfortably in my hands and allowed for one-handed use throughout all apps I tried. Upgrading to the iPhone 6 will be like upgrading from an iPhone 5 to an iPhone 5S\u2014yes, it\u2019s bigger, but it\u2019s also very comfortable. It will be a very easy upgrade for most people. That said, I\u2019d be hard pressed to guess which model will be the top seller for Apple. The company has proven in the past that the inexpensive model isn\u2019t always the top seller. I think many people will be like me and need to see it in person and see how it feels. It\u2019s a departure for Apple, but one they could make work with iOS 8 and the special gestures incorporated into the software.\n\nWhile the new iPhone 6 isn\u2019t lighter than the iPhone 5, it feels incredibly thin compared to the iPhone 5s I had on hand for comparisons. In terms of the design of the device, it\u2019s clear that Apple had to break some trends that seemed to be present in previous iPhones. For one, the noticeable camera bump came from a need to maintain and/or improve camera quality while simultaneously driving down z-height overall, so there seems to have been an industrial design trade-off here for the sake of functionality. There\u2019s also the relatively thick plastic lines which are a departure from previous designs but seem to be necessary for NFC capabilities. I\u2019m personally unsure how I feel on these two design elements, but they may be an issue for some.\n\nThe back of the phones are made out of aluminum with some clearly visible cutouts made to allow wireless signals in and out. The design as a whole is more reminiscent of the 2012 iPod Touch than current iPhones, an observation that extends to the slightly protruding camera lens. You won\u2019t notice this bulge if you keep your phone in a case or sit it on a soft surface, but if you set the phone on a hard table it definitely will wobble a bit in place. Both phones feel lighter than you\u2019d expect them to\u20144.55 ounces for the 6 and 6.07 ounces for the 6 Plus, compared to 5.64 ounces for the 5-inch HTC One M8 or 5.08 ounces for the new Moto X\u2014but they still feel as sturdy as you\u2019d expect from an Apple product.\n\nIn the hand, the iPhone 6 definitely feels noticeably larger, but what\u2019s remarkable is that it doesn\u2019t feel significantly bulky. The rounded sides and thin, lightweight chassis kind of harken back to older devices, in fact, like the iPhone 3GS and earlier, but the more premium materials used here add another dimension of quality. Playing with the new camera reveals the improvements there are also impressive. The iPhone 6 gets all the new features besides optical image stabilization, including slow motion video at 240 FPS, which is two times faster than the iPhone 5s (and so two times slower when played back). The camera\u2019s autofocus is fast and effective thanks to the addition of phase detection, and it no longer highlights the point of focus, which it doesn\u2019t really need to because of its improvements.\n\nNaturally, there\u2019s going to be some hesitation by those who\u2019ve been used to the 3.5-inch or 4-inch size of all previous generations of the iPhone, but the 4.7-inch model is still reasonable enough that most users should easily get used to the new size. At 6.9mm, it\u2019s thinner than the 5s (7.6mm), and its curved sides bring a sleek look that should still be plenty comfortable for most traditional iPhone fans. I had no problem gripping the iPhone 6, and it felt right at home in my palms.\n\nAt 4.7-inches, the device doesn\u2019t feel big; the thinness might help perpetuate that illusion, or maybe it\u2019s just that we\u2019re used to from bigger devices. It\u2019s also really light, and the power button being moved to the right side is in the perfect spot. You won\u2019t have to stretch your hand up to the top just to sleep/wake your device. It looks like a major step up from the iPhone 5s, and we know how much Apple fans loved that design.\n\nWhen you are done reading the early first impressions, you can voice your opinion on the iPhone 6 in the comments.

Despite rumors that had placed it launching in mid-2014, it looks like Apple is now planning a mid-2015 launch of the new MacBook. Previous rumors had suggested that, if not in mid-2014, then late in the same year, or early 2015.

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have a whole bunch of new features, including a larger display, a better camera, a faster processor, a longer battery life and more. If you\u2019ve completed your contract, the iPhone 6 starts at $199 and the iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299, both for the 16GB model with 64GB, and 128GB configurations available as well.\n\nShould you upgrade to iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus from your current iPhone\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided you want to upgrade, the next question is\u00a0\u201cWhich iPhone 6 variant do you choose?\u201d The iPhone lineup had just one top-of-the-line model earlier, but this time there are two flagship models, the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus.\n\niPhone 6 vs iPhone 6 Plus: Does size really matter?\n\nIf you are considering switching carriers and finding the best plan for you based on cost and what each package includes in terms of talk, text and data, we\u2019ve done the homework for you and prepared a guide:\n\nAT&T vs. Verizon vs. Sprint vs. T-Mobile: Which iPhone 6 carrier to choose based on cost\n\nThe next step is deciding which storage capacity to buy. Apple changed the storage configurations with the iPhone 6. While the lineup starts at 16GB, the next model isn\u2019t 32GB, it\u2019s 64GB, and the top storage capacity is 128GB. The choice here is heavily dependant on your usage patterns. If you use a lot of cloud storage and streaming services, then you\u2019ll likely be ok with the 16GB model. If you shoot a lot of photos and videos or like playing heavy games, then you might want to go with the 64GB or 128GB option.\n\n16GB, 64GB or 128GB \u2014 Which iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus storage capacity should you buy\n\nThe iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus come in three colors:\u00a0Space Gray, Gold and Silver.

In this column, join us as we do a side-by-side comparison of AppleCare with other warranty plans available.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about something that a lot of people might not realize off the top: when you purchase an iPhone 6 or any Apple device, it is automatically covered under a one-year limited warranty for no additional cost. It doesn\u2019t matter if you purchased the device directly from Apple, or through Amazon, Best Buy or any Apple authorized reseller.\n\nAs this warranty plan is cost free, you can probably imagine that it is fairly limited in scope. Essentially, the only two things that are covered are the iPhone 6\u2019s hardware and any consumable parts \u2014 in other words, the battery \u2014 if they are damaged or dysfunctional due to a manufacturing defect. Plus, 90 days of complimentary phone support.\n\nFortunately, a few years ago, AppleCare+ was introduced. This warranty plan, which has supplemented\u00a0the standard AppleCare in most countries,\u00a0expands your coverage areas, provides you with more customer service options and covers accidental damage under certain conditions.\n\nAppleCare+ doubles\u00a0your one-year limited warranty plan\u00a0to two years from the original purchase date of the device, in addition to extending\u00a0your complimentary phone support from 90 days to 2 years. You must purchase this plan within 60 days purchasing your iPhone 6 and provide that your device is undamaged and in proper working order.\n\nAppleCare+ will set you back a one-time payment of $99 if you are purchasing the warranty plan for an iPhone 6. That might sound like an unnecessary additional cost, but the good thing about AppleCare+ is that it covers up to two incidents of accidental damage for a $79 service fee.\u00a0In most cases, that\u2019s a lot cheaper than fixing your iPhone yourself.\n\nImagine this: it is a hot summer day and you are ready to go swimming in your friend\u2019s pool in his or her backyard. You\u2019re excited to escape the heat and cool off in the water, get your bathing suit on and jump right in. A few seconds later, you realize that your iPhone was in your pocket. Frantically, you get out of the pool and assess the damage.\n\nA quick Google search has told you to put the soaked iPhone in a bowl of rice to dry out, but it is of little use. Your iPhone is dead.\u00a0Accidents happen, and that\u2019s where AppleCare+ can save your behind for a fraction of the cost that Apple authorized service would cost.\n\nIn addition to covering accidental physical or water damage, AppleCare+ will also replace your defective or broken iPhone headphones or Lightning cable and a battery that has depleted by more than 50 percent within your warranty coverage period. What\u2019s not covered includes a lost or stolen device, normal wear and tear and software problems.\n\nApple also specifically outlines that jailbroken devices are not eligible for AppleCare+ coverage, since modifying your device in that manner is a violation of the company\u2019s End User License Agreement (EULA). However, a quick restore\u00a0of the device to factory settings through iTunes should\u00a0remove all traces of jailbreaking.\n\nAppleCare+ applies internationally and is transferrable, meaning that if you purchase a used device still covered by the warranty plan, it remains in effect until its normal expiration date.\n\nIf you are a Visa, MasterCard, American Express or other credit card holder, be sure to consult one of these companies to see what kind of warranty coverage they might offer. In a lot of cases, you might be surprised to find out you are automatically covered for free or substantially less than a lot of third-party warranty plans cost.\n\nFor instance, based on personal knowledge, the RBC Visa in Canada has an Extended Warranty Insurance that is offered to all cardholders and doubles your manufacturer\u2019s warranty \u2014 in this case, the one-year limited warranty on an iPhone 6 \u2014 from the date the manufacturer\u2019s warranty expires. The policy applies for a maximum of five years.\n\nBefore you explore any other third-party warranties available, be sure to consult your credit card company for further information. A quick online search will usually yield information about your card issuer\u2019s warranty options.\n\nYou have done your homework on credit card warranties and want to explore various third-party electronics warranty providers. Enter SquareTrade, which offers an iPhone protection plan that costs $5 per month, $99 for two years or $129 for three years and covers drops, spills and malfunctions for a $75 deductible.\n\nThe $99 upfront cost of SquareTrade is cheaper than insurance plans available through AT&T, Verizon, Sprint or Best Buy, and the $75 deductible is four dollars cheaper than what AppleCare+ charges. It\u2019s important to note that, just as is the case with AppleCare, loss or theft of your iPhone is not covered.\n\nSquareTrade\u2019s protection plan includes reimbursement for any Genius Bar repairs, same day repair at any local service shop and next-day replacement. The repairs that are reimbursed include a cracked screen, camera failure, battery failure, liquid damage, charging port failure, touchscreen malfunction, headphone jack problems and more.\n\nIt is highly recommended that you do not invest the money into a carrier or retailer insurance plan, as these warranties are often outsourced to third-party companies and charge exorbitant deductibles or monthly charges. For instance, paying a $10 monthly fee and $200 or so deductible through AT&T quickly adds up and makes it not worthwhile.\n\nInstead of shelling out additional money to AT&T, Verizon, Sprint or Best Buy, which the chart above shows clearly aren\u2019t the cheapest options, you are probably much better off considering AppleCare+ or SquareTrade.\n\nOverall, choosing a warranty plan will depend on how much you are willing to spend, how well you take care of your iPhone and what is available in your area. A good starting point would be to purchase a durable case and screen protector for your iPhone, as drops and water damage are two common causes of broken devices.\n\nIs your iPhone covered by a warranty plan?", "wordchoice": ["a", "your", "support", "until", "that", "note", "can", "an", "warranties", "your", "certain", "is"], "title": "iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus Insurance"}, {"url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/iphonedlb/~3/ILLE8Sqz2lo/", "corpus": "Apple has just taken its online store down, ahead of the\u00a0pre-order launch for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

In each level you must figure out how to draw a path with one color, and then cover it up with another using the right amount of moves.\n\nIn its Editors\u2019 Notes section, Apple calls Bicolor a \u201cfascinatingly minimal game, that will keep you captivated with intriguing controls, euphoria-inducing audio design, and deceptively difficult puzzles.\u201d It adds that it\u2019s incredibly easy to learn, but very difficult to master.\n\nHere\u2019s a video of the game in action:\n\nAdmittedly, the game is a little intimidating and tough to understand before\u00a0playing it, but once you get into the tutorial it\u2019s easy to catch on.\u00a0We named Bicolor\u00a0one of our Apps of the Week in May, and we think it\u2019s definitely worth grabbing from the App Store while it\u2019s\u00a0free.", "wordchoice": ["hear", "and", "free", "intimidating", "euphoria", "intriguing", "the", "goes", "one", "the", "worth", "it"], "title": "Bicolor goes free as Apple\u2019s App of the Week"}, {"url": "http://www.macworld.com/article/2682592/how-when-and-where-to-preorder-the-iphone-6.html#tk.rss_all", "corpus": "Tonight\u2019s the night. The hour draws near. Put on a pot of coffee and set an alarm. iPhone 6 preorders start at midnight.\n\nBut Apple isn\u2019t the only place you can place your order. Big box retailers like Walmart and Best Buy will also take preorders, and of course your friendly carrier stores are eager to help you too. You probably already know what color and capacity you\u2019re after, so now it\u2019s a matter of figuring out where to actually place your order.\n\nThere\u2019s something to be said about going right to the source. Preorders start at 12:01 a.m. on Friday (which is Thursday night, of course, not Friday night), and Apple has a trade-in program if you\u2019d like to get a gift card for your old iPhone, and even offers financing (although if you don\u2019t pay in full by the end of the zero-interest period, the interest rate is steep, from 23 to 29 percent).\n\nCustomers of AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon can check their upgrade eligibility directly on Apple\u2019s site, which also has a detailed breakdown of plans by carrier. If you\u2019re a T-Mobile customer, be aware that you\u2019ll be paying full price if you preorder the iPhone 6 from Apple, starting at $649. For no-money-down options, preorder directly from T-Mobile.\n\nIf you want to preorder your iPhone right from AT&T, first check if you\u2019re eligible for an upgrade. The preorder period starts at 12:01 a.m. Pacific time (3:01 a.m. on the East Coast).\n\nIf you\u2019re on one of AT&T\u2019s new Mobile Share Value plans (formerly called Family Share Plans) that give you a single bucket of data shared by multiple phones, Rob Griffiths has some distrubing news about the end of a discount if you buy your new iPhone 6 under contract, versus paying for it monthly with an AT&T Next plan or buying the full-price version.\n\nAT&T has a trade-in program too, but you get a gift card for buying more phones from AT&T. According to a forum post by an AT&T community specialist, you could apply the gift card to a credit on your wireless bill only by taking the card to a corporate-owned AT&T Store.\n\nVerizon lets you enter your number to see if you\u2019re eligible to upgrade. Preorders start at 12:01 a.m. Friday (again, that\u2019s Thursday night for people who don\u2019t believe the hokum that a new day starts at midnight instead of when you wake up in the morning).\n\nVerizon Edge lets you pay for the iPhone\u2019s cost over 20 months, with no upgrade fees, and comes with a $25 discount on the shared-data More Everything plan. But Verizon also sells the phones on contract and at full price if you\u2019d rather go that route.\n\nIf the thought of staying up until 12:01 a.m. has you yawning already, Sprint can get you to bed a full 60 seconds earlier, as the carrier will begin taking preorders at midnight on the dot.\n\nSprint\u2019s helpful iPhone landing page breaks down all the purchase and plan options for individuals and families, and if you\u2019re transfering your number from AT&T or Verizon, you can get a prepaid Visa card to pay off your early termination fee or the installment plan on your last device. You have to register and upload a copy of your last bill to be eligible, but a payout of up to $350 is worth jumping through a few hoops. Just be sure to read all the fine print, of course.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got an old phone to unload, T-Mobile and Sprint are running competing trade-in programs too, and offering to beat each other\u2019s best deals.\n\nT-Mobile will be the only U.S. carrier that supports Wi-Fi calling at first, and thanks to a partnership with Gogo, you can even send texts from a plane. Preorders start Friday at 12:01 a.m. Pacific.\n\nWith the Simple Choice plan, you would pay $0 up front for a 16GB iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, and then pay $27.08 or $31.24, respectively, for 24 months. If you want more storage, 64GB models are $100 up front, and 128GB models are $200 up front, with the same monthly prices ($27.08 for the iPhone 6 and $31.25 for the 6 Plus). T-Mobile is extra attractive for travelers, since the carrier offers unlimited data and texting when you\u2019re overseas.\n\nTarget will let you preorder in person when stores open on Friday, if you\u2019d rather get your beauty rest tonight and take care of this in the light of day. It\u2019s selling phones for Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T, with two-year contract requirements.\n\nWalmart will offer just the 16GB versions of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, for Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T, but if that\u2019s enough storage or you, Walmart will knock $20 off Apple\u2019s official price (making that 16GB phone just $179 on contract) and toss in a $15 gift card for preordering. Walmart has its own trade-in program, and its warehouse store Sam\u2019s Club will have iPhones for preorder too.\n\nRadio Shack is offering gift cards too, but for $50, and you have until September 27 to place your order.

Deleon had been paying $40 per year for 25 GB of storage, but will start paying $12 per year on October 10. To cover the price difference between now and then, Apple is giving Deleon a prorated refund of $2.38.\n\nApple's iCloud storage plans previously included 5 GB of free data and cost $20 per year for an extra 10 GB, $40 per year for 20 GB, and $100 per year for 50 GB.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Apple's new storage plans cost $1 per month for 20 GB, $4 per month for 200 GB, $10 per month for 500 GB and $20 per month for 1 TB. All users will still get 5 GB of data for free.\n\nThe new plans coincide with big changes in how iCloud deals with photos and data. Instead of pushing Photo Stream as the main way to wirelessly sync all photos across devices, Apple will offer an \u201ciCloud Photo Library\u201d that stores everything online and lets users download only the photos they want to new devices. Unlike with Photo Stream, the Photo Library won't limit syncing to your last 1000 images, but it will require you to buy more storage if you reach the free 5 GB limit.\n\nAt the same time, Apple will offer a tool called iCloud Drive, which lets users manage all their online files, including photos, documents and app data. It's similar to true cloud storage programs like Dropbox and Google Drive, and it'll work with both Windows PCs and Macs. The change should make users' cloud storage less opaque and easier to manage directly.\n\nJust keep in mind that while Apple has dropped the price of its cloud storage plans, other competing services are still much cheaper. Google Drive and Dropbox both offer 1 TB of storage for $10 per month, and Microsoft offers 1 TB as part of an Office 365 subscription starting at $70 per year.

But speaking to Re/code, Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris confirm that users should get used to a nightly charge.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate that people will charge nightly which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging,\u201d Kerris said.\n\nDespite the talk of innovation, a couple of Android Wear watches already rely on similar solution. LG's G Watch comes with a magnetic charging cradle, so users can just plop the watch on top before they go to bed. Motorola's Moto 360 uses a wireless charging stand that isn't magnetic, but holds the watch upright so it can double as a nightstand clock. While it'd be nice if users didn't have to charge up every night, the routine isn't too unbearable when the charging mechanism is hassle-free.\n\nApple also revealed a clever way to protect against watch theft, which is especially important since the watch supports tap-to-pay credit card transactions at certain stores. According to Cult of Mac, the Apple Watch's rear sensor can tell when someone's wearing it, and requires a PIN when users first strap the watch on. Thieves won't be able to make payments without the code, and they may be deterred from trying to swipe the watch at all.\n\nThere's still a lot we don't know about the Apple Watch, including its dimensions, weight and storage capacity.

A cutesy messaging app isn\u2019t exactly his style, so I let the email sit in my inbox for a few days. Then he nudged me and asked when I was going to download Couple. He was serious.\n\nI kept the sarcastic comments to myself and finally succumbed to being the other half of his digital pair. I laughed and rolled my eyes at Couple\u2019s features, like a \u201cthumb kiss\u201d where you touch thumbs to your screen at the same time, and the \u201cthinking of you\u201d button that sends your partner a message letting them know you are doing just that.\n\nBut 11 months later, it\u2019s one of the most used apps on my phone. My boyfriend travels a ton for work and we\u2019re constantly in different time zones, so having a single place to drop by and leave a note, a photo, or add an item to our grocery list is really convenient. Could we do these sorts of things in other messaging apps? Sure, but there is something unique and far more intimate about your own private social network rather than using one filled with the noise of your friends, parents, and colleagues.\n\nSince our first relationship app experience, we\u2019ve tried out a bunch more to see how they compare.\n\nCouple was the first and still my favorite relationship app. The design is primarily based around the chat function, which is what we use most. Like most relationship apps, Couple allows you to do things like sketch an image, share a voice memo, snap photos and apply various Instagram-esque filters. The list function on Couple makes it easy to keep track of groceries, movies we want to watch, or places we\u2019d like to travel. On Couple\u2019s home screen you can see your partner\u2019s location and what music they\u2019re listening to, if you turn on those sharing functions.\n\nCouple is also integrated with Foursquare. You can drop a pin on your address and find restaurant recommendations nearby or send your partner your location. Couple makes money by selling sticker packs inside the app, and I admit we\u2019ve already bought four of them. Couple doesn\u2019t have quite as many bells and whistles as some of the other relationship apps out there, but it does what we need it to do really well. I plan to keep it around.\n\nHowAboutWe launched their version of a relationship app a few months back. Coming from a company that does a lot of cool things for those looking for or in love, I was excited to try it out. The app\u2019s design isn\u2019t my favorite, but it does feel young and fresh. You&Me has a ton of photo features if you and your partner really like sending each other images. You can take a \u201chalfsie,\u201d which is a selfie you each take stitched together (yes, that feature makes me gag a bit, too). It also has a cute photobooth option to take a few shots at once and share your photo strip. Another photo feature is a \u201csecret,\u201d or an image where your partner has to wipe away steam from the screen to see what you shared.\n\nMy favorite You&Me function is the ability to send songs to your significant other. Though the catalog isn\u2019t extensive, it\u2019s a fun little feature. My biggest pet peeve: I have push notifications turned off, yet the app continues to pester me daily about turning them back on. You&Me might be best for couples in long-distance relationships who need a lot of media functions to fill the gap.\n\nEverything about Avocado is cute, including its name. This app includes the basic functions you\u2019d expect, but manages to be extra adorable with its \u201chug and kiss\u201d features. When you want to send your partner a hug, Avocado has you hold your phone against your chest\u2014yes, I know this sounds so absurdly cheesy\u2014and it sends a message letting your significant other know you\u2019ve hugged them. The \u201csend a kiss\u201d feature allows you to plant virtual wet ones all over your partner\u2019s face by either kissing the screen (gross) or just tapping their photo. It\u2019s far more endearing than it sounds, I promise.\n\nAvocado also sends you an alert to let you know if your partner\u2019s phone battery is running low, which is great but kind of odd. It seemed a tiny bit too intrusive, though you can shut this function off, but also might be useful for people who worry if their partner hasn\u2019t texted them back in a while.\n\nAvocado falls short compared to other apps for couples because of its freemium nature. To create more than five lists, share more than 200 images, or unlock unlimited messaging features, you have to sign up for the premium subscription, which is $15 for a year. It\u2019s not worth it when there are so many other free options without sharing restrictions. Since chat functionality is what we mainly use, I also wish it would let you resize the chat screen to fit more text on it.\n\nKorean messaging app Between has a different feel and way better emoji packs than other apps for couples. It also has a beautiful home screen, which tells you the weather forecast in the place your significant other is located, lets you set up a countdown until a big event like a vacation, and has a box where it can deliver you special offers, though I haven\u2019t gotten any yet. Between\u2019s sticker store offerings are the most impressive with dozens of sets to pick from. Where the app falls short is in the photo department\u2014it doesn\u2019t have as many cool functions as some of the other apps I\u2019ve tried. It also lacks a list feature, which is one of the main reasons my boyfriend and I use a relationship app, so we\u2019re sticking with Couple.", "wordchoice": ["where", "Another", "where", "doesn", "was", "low", "to", "offers", "more", "kiss", "relationship", "halfsie"], "title": "Party of two: 4 slightly cheesy but still endearing apps for couples"}, {"url": "http://www.macworld.com/article/2604675/swiftkey-reveals-details-about-its-ios-8-keyboard.html#tk.rss_all", "corpus": "We heard a little bit about iOS 8 during Tuesday\u2019s explosion of Apple announcements\u2014namely, Tim Cook announced that the latest version of Apple\u2019s mobile operating system will be available on September 17.

Die Zeit, sich f\u00fcr eine der beiden iPhone-Gr\u00f6\u00dfen zu entscheiden, dr\u00e4ngt. Ein Dilemma.\n\nTechnische Unterschiede kl\u00e4ren die Frage nicht. 4.7- und 5.5-Zoll trennt ein minimaler Gewichtsunterschied, eine schon deutlichere Akkulaufzeit sowie eine optische Bildstabilisierung, die eine bessere Fotoqualit\u00e4t unter schlechten Lichtverh\u00e4ltnissen jedoch erst noch beweisen muss.\n\nWer nicht ohnehin das gr\u00f6\u00dfere Retina HD Display bevorzugt, w\u00e4gt derzeit wahrscheinlich ab, ob er die physikalische \u00dcbergr\u00f6\u00dfe in Kauf nimmt um auf dickerem Batterie-Fu\u00df zu leben. Damit entfernen wir uns von einer rein technischen Diskussion und argumentieren praxisnah. Wo befindet sich mein iPhone wenn ich arbeite? Auf dem Schreibtisch oder in der Hosentasche? Wie lange fahre ich t\u00e4glich zur Arbeit und wie oft halte ich das iPhone davon ohnehin in der Hand? Wie oft telefoniere ich, mit dem Telefon am Ohr, oder wie oft lese, tippe und interagiere ich mit dem Bildschirm? Was f\u00fcr Sport treibe ich? Laufband oder Waldlauf?\n\nDie Antworten sind so vielf\u00e4ltig, dass man daraus keine allgemeine Aussage ableiten kann, sondern ausschlie\u00dflich auf sich selbst schauen muss. Es gibt keine Empfehlung, sondern lediglich das Apple-Statement, dass nun auch gr\u00f6\u00dfere Smartphones mit iOS laufen. Ich zweifle keine Sekunde daran, dass hier erstmals eine gigantische K\u00e4uferschicht angesprochen wird, die vorher nicht bedient wurde.\n\nUnd wer sich \u00fcberhaupt nicht auf \u201eMehr als gr\u00f6\u00dfer\u201c einstellen kann, findet mit dem 5s ein g\u00fcnstigeres Ger\u00e4t, das auch locker ein Jahr nach seiner ersten Vorstellung noch unter den besten Smartphones mitmischt. Dass sich auch das iPhone 5c weiter im Programm h\u00e4lt, zeigt, das Apple mit den Verk\u00e4ufen zufrieden ist. Wer glaubt, dass das Telefon nur noch ein Extra-Jahr mitgeschleppt wird um sich nicht den Fehltritt-Titel aufzusetzen, kennt Apple schlecht.\n\n4.7- und 5.5-Zoll kan\u00adni\u00adba\u00adli\u00adsie\u00adren selbstverst\u00e4ndlich das eigene iPad mini.

Apple sortiert Produkte aus, wenn sie nicht laufen oder ihren Zenit \u00fcberschritten haben, egal was die Presse dazu schreibt.\n\nAber iPads sind ein gutes Stichwort. Wer ein iPad besitzt, insbesondere ein 4G-Modell, k\u00f6nnte dies beim iPhone-Kauf ber\u00fccksichtigen. Wer im Oktober erw\u00e4gt ein neues Mini und Air zu shoppen, kann das schon heute in seinen iPhone-Kaufentscheidung einflie\u00dfen lassen.

Every week, we tune in for a rerun of an RPG from App Store days gone by for a little reflection and revisiting. I'll do my best to keep things a bit varied and balanced between the many different kinds of RPGs out there, but once a month, in order to defend human freedom against my ruthless determination to rule the world, the selection falls to you, the reader. Our next reader's choice feature will be in RPG Reload 008, so please vote for the RPG you want to see me write about in either the comments below or the Official RPG Reload Club thread in our forums. Those are also both great places to share your thoughts, experiences, fresh comedy, and knowledge.\n\nThis week, however, I'm in Battlecat's saddle, and I've decided to go with something a bit more low key than the more famous hits of previous reloads. This week, I'm going for nostalgia of a different sort by looking at Mighty Rabbit's Saturday Morning RPG [Free / $5.99], an underappreciated little gem if there ever was one, in my opinion. Like many of the cartoons of our youth, it was clearly meant to span more episodes than it will ever get, and in its current state, it barely runs over the 10-hour mark, but it's a really good 10 hours, especially if the nostalgia lines up with you. Also, in some good news, there is at least one more episode coming, and I have to guess that it will provide a bit of closure to the whole thing. Even as it stands, however, I think this is a pretty special game.\n\nI think most fans of RPGs will have, at some point, come into contact with one of Nintendo's Mario RPGs. Whether it's the original Square-developed Super Mario RPG, the Paper Mario games from Intelligent Systems, or the Mario & Luigi games from ex-Square Alpha Dream, the Mario RPGs are actually among the highest-selling RPGs worldwide, and with good reason. They're incredibly accessible, make good use of humor, and use a variety of techniques to make the battles a bit more active for the player. These games bridge the gap between the RPG hardcore and the less RPG-savvy Mario fanbase without pushing away either. Well, usually, anyway. I'm not here to write a defense of Paper Mario: Sticker Star. They're fun, approachable games that manage to turn RPG conventions on their heads here and there in very clever ways, with a loving wink to the crowd to let everyone know there's no spite involved.\n\nHey, wait, why am I talking about Mario RPGs? This article is supposed to be about Saturday Morning RPG! Well, I'm talking about them for two reasons: First, because I love those games and will write words about them any chance I get, but more relevantly, I'm doing it because Saturday Morning RPG is the closest thing to a Mario RPG we've got on the App Store, and likely the closest we'll ever have for quite some time. All those nice things I say up there about the Mario RPGs apply to Saturday Morning RPG as well. I mean, except for the highest-selling thing, unfortunately. Now, you might think that none of this is a surprise, since the developer themselves openly state the Mario games were one of their inspirations. Listing off inspirations is easy, though. Actually doing them justice is another matter entirely.\n\nIt's a tricky thing to pull off, and it's very easy to overdo certain things and miss others on your first swing, and that's just what happened with Saturday Morning RPG's initial release. I'm getting ahead of myself, though. Let's start with a brief outline of the game. The game follows the story of Marty Michael Hall, a regular teenager who comes into possession of a magical faux-Trapper Keeper that allows him to fight the surprisingly rampant cartoon evils that plague his hometown of Shadow Valley. The exploration portions of the game are very similar to other JRPG-style games, but the battle system is a little bit different. It relies very heavily on magic attacks, with your only melee attack option doing very little damage. You can also use your turn to charge up your next attack. Much like the Mario RPGs, most of your actions can be enhanced with timing-based taps or other brief inputs. Good timing will increase the damage you deal, decrease the damage enemies deal, and build up your magic meter.\n\nOne of these inputs involves tapping as quickly as you can on the screen, and this was one of the things that initially put some off of Saturday Morning RPG. When it released, the only way to charge up your next attack was to use a rapid-tap input. Since each of your magic items has a limited number of uses per fight and the melee attack is nearly useless, you're going to want to charge up your attacks almost every time. In hindsight, it's not hard to see why people ended up putting the game down. They probably needed to go get some ice for their poor fingers. A later update added two other methods of charging up attacks, one timing-based and the other a simple matter of selecting it from the menu. With that addition, the battle system finally found its footing. It errs a bit on the easy side, but the wide variety of attacks keep things fresh, the various mid-battle inputs keep you engaged, and for the most part, enemies don't take too long to finish off.\n\nThe magic attacks are one of the big areas where Saturday Morning RPG flexes its nostalgia muscles. You can bring five different magic items into battle with you, and each one can be used a limited amount of times in a single fight. Each new chapter added has brought a handful of new items with it, and the span of references to 1980s pop culture has become very wide. They include references to things that still have a fair bit of cultural cachet like the Transformers and some real \"you had to be there\" stuff like the bizarre McDonald's character Mac Tonight. There are so many different items to find, and they come so frequently, you'll constantly have new toys to play with. The balance on these items is absolutely all over the place, with some of them proving to be ridiculously overpowered, like the near-gamebreaking Karate Kid headband, and others seemingly just there for a punchline, like the B.B. Gun found in the Christmas episode that lives up to its reference to a tee.\n\nThese shots of nostalgia go nicely with the main course, which is served up in the game's story and exploration scenes. One funny thing about Saturday Morning RPG\u00a0is that what was originally just meant to be a nostalgia piece for the 1980s is also starting to get the air of circa-2010 nostalgia about it. The game obviously piles on the references to things like GI Joe, Back To The Future, Ghostbusters, Chuck E. Cheese, and John Hughes movies, but it also refers to contemporary-at-the-time memes like Rickrolling and Shia LaBeouf's penchant for saying the word 'no' a lot in his movies. There's a silly sense of humor to the game that fits the theme of a 1980s cartoon perfectly. Goofy, sometimes stupid, but always charming in its sincerity. Not every joke lands well even in that capacity, with the constant barrage of bear jokes, for example, overstaying their welcome, but enough of them find their target that it's easy to forgive those that don't.\n\nThe exploration bits do a good job of encouraging you to look around. You are awarded experience points just for touching certain out of the way areas, rare stickers and items can be found in hidden places, and sub-quests often have you covering a fair bit of ground to solve them. In the first two episodes, this can be a bit of a drag at times due to Marty's slow walking speed and the frequent battles, but from the third episode on, you have access to Marty's hoverboard, which greatly increases the speed of his movement. Only rarely do puzzles venture beyond fetching things and flipping switches, but when they do, they can be downright obscure in their solutions. The most difficult of the lot is probably the one found in the somewhat rough first episode. There's a door you need to open, and the only way to do it is to use the switches above the door to play the main hook to a somewhat well-known 80s hit.\n\nActually, I want to talk about that first episode a bit. Chances are good that for most people, it's their only experience with Saturday Morning RPG, and that's a real shame. Each new episode has shown considerable gains in design sophistication, and that first episode doesn't play any better now than it did when I first played it. The references are decent enough, and it does its job of introducing you to the mechanics of the game, but it does so in a very dull way. There's very little enemy variety, not a lot of items to play with, and you spend almost the whole time in a very drab cave setting. Other than leaving Marty with the magic book, it also has very little actual story significance. If you walked away from the game based on the first episode, I implore you to give the game another chance. It gets a lot better, I promise.\n\nThe shining example of that is the game's most recent episode as of the time of writing this article, the 2012 Christmas Special. Had this ended up the game's final episode, it would have been more than fitting, because it's hard to imagine how they could capture the essence of 80s children's programming better than they do here. The ending is just perfect, and has ensured that Saturday Morning RPG will stay in my Christmas game rotation for a long time to come. It's not the longest episode, clocking in at around two hours, but it truly demonstrates a development team that has become comfortable with what it's doing. The main dungeon for this episode avoids the excessive length of the Jean Claude Van Dam from the third episode, but still offers up a lot of side paths and a puzzle or two to keep it from being a combat tunnel like the dungeons in the first two episodes tended to be. It's also not nearly as buggy as the third chapter sometimes can be. Combat encounters are more interesting thanks to the present boxes, and the enemies that can paralyze you are an effective foil for Marty's excessive power by this point.\n\nAs is ideally the case with homegrown iOS games, Saturday Morning RPG has only gotten better with time. The main problems with the initial app came from the excessive tapping and the relatively small amount of content, and both of those things have been addressed satisfactorily, in my opinion. The design has also matured with each new added episode, and it makes me kind of sad that this team is most likely not going to be able to keep working on this type of game in the future. I'd really love to see what they would come up with if they went from the ground up on a new RPG, with everything they've learned. The app itself still holds up nicely thanks to Mighty Rabbit keeping on top of new developments with each content update. It fills the screen nicely, the 3D backgrounds look sharp, and the super-chunky pixels of the sprite characters look, well, they still look super-chunky, but they're supposed to. There are a few lingering bugs with some of the subquest event flags in the third episode, but they can usually be cleared up by saving and restarting the app.\n\nNow, obviously, Saturday Morning RPG's nostalgia isn't going to work out for everyone, but I think the game can stand on its own even if you aren't temporally aligned with its sense of humor. Whatever the initial plans might have been, it's clear that the game isn't ever going to be a big, massive, genre-defining RPG. I dare say, though I wish the developer had seen slightly better reward for it, the game itself has more or less turned out to be just what it ought to have been, and I think cutting back on its ambition was absolutely key to that. It's a slice of RPG comfort food. It's earnest, endlessly enthusiastic, and short enough that it's very easy to slide into the occasional gap in your RPG schedule. The pacing is very uneven, but it works out okay overall due to the episode-based format slicing things up into discrete chunks. Could it be more balanced, more challenging, bigger, more refined? Sure, but I think I love it partly because it's not those things. Saturday Morning RPG is like a meta-example of dreaming big, falling down, and picking yourself up and making the best of it anyway. If that's not a end-of-episode moral worthy of a thumbs-up from GI Joe's Shipwreck, I don't know what is.\n\nAt any rate, that's just what I think of the game. It's definitely a recommended reload in my books, especially if you haven't looked in on it since its launch. What do you folks think? Am I crackers for loving this game? Hopped up on 1980s nostalgia goofballs? Please leave your comments below or chime in at the Official RPG Reload Club. Don't forget to vote for the game you want to see in the next reader's choice article, please. Otherwise, it's going to go to something silly that got, like, three votes. By the power of Greyskull, you have the power, so exercise it. I'll be back next week with another dive into RPG Video Land. As always, thanks for reading!\n\nNext Week's Reload Hint: Getting a sequel to this classic is proving to be a distant objective.", "wordchoice": ["from", "more", "charge", "selling", "excessive", "always", "and", "Reload", "a", "third", "to", "the"], "title": "RPG Reload File 005 - 'Saturday Morning RPG'"}, {"url": "http://toucharcade.com/2014/09/11/moga-rebel-mfi-controller-hands-on-preview/", "corpus": "Yesterday, MOGA officially unveiled their first full-sized MFi controller for iOS devices, the MOGA Rebel. I had a chance to sit down with the final version of the hardware with company representatives in San Francisco and spend a little time trying it out. I'll be saving most of my thoughts for a full review in time for the controller's release next Wednesday, after spending the weekend really putting it through its paces, but for now here are some initial thoughts and a little hands-on video to give you a better idea of what the MOGA Rebel offers those looking for a decent full-size MFi controller.\n\nAs you can see, the Rebel mostly resembles an Xbox controller, with its offset dual-analog sticks and button arrangement. In terms of build quality the Rebel feels quite solid, though it still doesn't feel as solid as an actual 1st-party controller from an Xbox or PlayStation. It feels lighter than either of those, and has more of a plasticky feel, but it still feels like a well-built piece of equipment. The buttons have a nice clicky feel, and the L and R analog triggers feel especially good in terms of resistance and springiness. The two analog sticks also feel great, though they're a bit looser than I prefer.\n\nThe Rebel is equipped with a flip-out arm right in the middle of the controller that can hold your iPhone or iPod touch in place while you play, and this is by far my favorite feature. As much as I like my current favorite MFi controller, the Steel Series Stratus, I just don't feel compelled to prop up an iPad on my coffee table and hunch over with the controller in my hands just to play a game. With the Rebel, I can just slide my iPhone into the arm and kick back and play, whether that be laying down on the couch, standing in line at the movies, or whatever. Putting a device in and out of the arm is incredibly easy, and it's also super grippy and secure.\n\nHere's a quick video of us trying out a couple of MFi supported games with the rebel, Bioshock [$14.99] and Bastion [$4.99], as well as a look at the MOGA World app which will be launching alongside the Rebel next week.\n\nOverall, my impressions after yesterday's demo and my own time playing around with a review unit last night is that this is far and away the best full-sized MFi controller on market. Now, there's not a ton of competition in that area, and there are a few negatives to the Rebel. Obviously pricing is an issue as it is with every MFi controller, and at $79.99, while the Rebel definitely does feel like a well-built piece of hardware, it still doesn't feel like something that costs $79.99. Also, as much as I love the flip-out arm to hold my device, it doesn't flip all the way back, and the angle at which it stops feels a bit too forward for my taste. That's a very minor problem though, and one I'm quickly getting used to.\n\nAnother strange thing I haven't touched on yet is the d-pad. It's very\u2026 strange. The entire d-pad is one giant, bowl-shaped circle rather than a \"plus\" shape or even four separate buttons situated in a plus shape like a PlayStation controller. It seems to have been designed to have you place your thumb in the center and keep it there, and press the various directions by kind of \"rolling\" your thumb, sort of like how a virtual analog stick works on a touchscreen. I need to play with it some more, but it seems like a strange design decision. The Android equivalent of the Rebel has a true plus-shaped d-pad, and why they didn't just do one of those here is a mystery.\n\nAt any rate, these are all just early impressions, and my overall gut feeling for the Rebel is that this will be the one to get if you want a full-size MFi controller. It goes on sale online and in Apple stores on September 17th for $79.99, and we should have a full review of the unit in time for that.", "wordchoice": ["just", "kick", "to", "it", "devices", "a", "of", "next", "t", "of", "nice", "t"], "title": "Hands-On Video and Impressions of the MOGA Rebel MFi Controller"}, {"url": "http://toucharcade.com/2014/09/11/check-out-the-sleeping-prince-projection-mapping-trailer/", "corpus": "I don't know what it is with Tilting Point and their whole \"We must outdo absolutely everyone when it comes to trailer production values\" thing, but, hey, why not.

Goat-herding iPhone developer Phil Hassey is the first (and only) person to answer the call so far, and he's got some neat plans for the upcoming Galcon 2.\n\nBacking things up a bit, if you missed the keynote during the iPhone 6 Plus reveal, there's more to it than just a bigger screen. Core iOS apps will work a little differently with the 6 Plus. For instance, if you turn the phone to landscape mode with the Mail app open, you'll get what looks like a downsized version of the iPad Mail app with email messages on the left and the selected message on the right. It's a really cool way to utilize the extra screen space instead of just making everything bigger.\n\nGalcon 2 has been in development for two years now, and is nearing release. It's possible that it could be the first game to do something similar with the iPhone 6 Plus. Phil is actually approaching the capability of the phone in an interesting way- Players will essentially have the ability to toggle the iPad interface on and off in the game's menu. Here's how that will look, with the iPhone 5 game on the top and the same game being simulated on an iPhone 6 with the iPad mode enabled on the bottom (It's a little hard to visualize with the screenshots being the same size inline, but imagine the bottom one being twice as big in your hands comparatively):\n\nSo, you'll be able to get a 48 planet layout instead of the iPhone default layout of 23 planets on the iPhone 6 Plus. Phil mentions it plays fine on his iPod touch with 48 planets on screen, so it should be pretty awesome on the iPhone 6 Plus. Another example he gave of how the 6 Plus will have a more iPad-like layout is in the game lobbies. Here's how it will look on the iPhone 4 in portrait mode, but in landscape mode between the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 6 Plus Galcon 2 will take a similar approach to the Apple Mail example above. Again, the iPhone 5 interface is on the top while the iPhone 6 Plus interface is on the bottom:\n\nThe chat is way better, since it can just get shifted to its own frame on the right which will let players see way more messages than they can in landscape on the iPhone 5 family. Additionally, allowing players to optionally use the iPad interface for games seems like a clever solution that doesn't take a total top down redesign of the interface to do. There was a lot of doom and gloom following the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus announcements regarding platform fragmentation due to the different screen sizes, but Phil shows it might not be as bad as a lot of people want to think.\n\nAs mentioned, Galcon 2 is still \"coming soon,\" but if you've yet to play a Galcon game, they're definitely App Store classics at this point.

It was a mechanically sound example of the genre with charm to spare, but it definitely suffered from the usual chapter one problem of doing a whole lot of setting up and not much paying off. If you played it, chances are good that you fell in love with its jazzy, dark atmosphere and lovable protagonist, Bwana. Chances are also good that after finishing the game's two and a half hour adventure, you went looking for a magic lamp to wish up the next chapter. It's been a bit of a wait, but The Journey Down: Chapter Two [$4.99] is finally here, and it's an excellent continuation of the story.\n\nWhen we last left Bwana, he was demonstrating his amazing piloting skills to his client, the lovely Lina, as they took off in search of the fabled Underland. We pick up soon after his landing, with everyone mostly intact, rescued by the crew of a mister ship. Soon, our group finds themselves in the seedy town of Port Artue, separated and on the wrong side of the law. It's up to Bwana to get him and Kito out of the mess they're in, reunite with Lina, and continue on their expedition to find out what happened to his father figure, Captain Kaonandodo. The story covered in this chapter feels a lot more satisfying and full, not least of which is owed to the length of this chapter being just about double the first chapter, or around five hours. A lot of things happen this time around, though with a promised third chapter to close out the trilogy, the biggest questions remain unanswered. At the very least, you're not spending most of the chapter just fixing a plane.\n\nAs before, you're looking at a pretty orthodox adventure game in the latter-day Lucasarts style. The style of the game is unlike almost anything else. All of the characters cleverly have African-style masks for faces, which gives them a very unique look and also lets the artists get away with a bit less animation. The cast is even bigger than the first game, with lots of weird and memorable characters to interact with. Most of the game takes place in very dark, almost noir-like areas, but the game does play with your expectations a bit over the course of the chapter. As in the first chapter, every line in the game is voiced quite capably, and the game's soundtrack is just fantastic. Work of this caliber coming from such a small team is almost shocking, and it's easy to see why it took so long to develop.\n\nThe unique presentation is the main way the game differentiates itself from other adventure games. In other respects, it more or less walks the line, but it does so very competently. You can bring up nearby hotspots just by holding your finger on the screen, items are easily used by opening your inventory and dragging them onto whatever you want to use them on, and Bwana will go anywhere you tap your finger. The puzzles are generally pretty logical for a game in this genre, and the game is pretty good about limiting your options just enough to keep things from getting too complicated. In Lucasarts style, you can't get yourself into any unwinnable situations and you can't die, so there's no risk in trying whatever crazy things you want. The only time I ran into trouble was when I had difficulty spotting an exit on a particularly dark background. I could have easily spotted it if I had dragged my finger around the screen, but it looked completely dark, so I didn't bother trying. After that little snag, things generally went smoothly for the rest of the game. The game's climactic puzzle is a pretty good head-scratcher, and it was pretty enjoyable piecing it all together.\n\nI feel that the heart of the game is in its strong core cast of characters. Bwana is a wonderful hero, a little bit naive, but eternally optimistic, and his brother Kito is even more so. I really like these guys, and I want to see them win. Bwana's innocent nature and his sense of wonder at almost anything helps cover up the fact that he's explaining a lot of things out loud to the player. I do wish there were more scenes with Kito, but perhaps moderation is to his benefit. He really is completely unflappable, and I love it. I'm not so sold on Lina, but if nothing else, she tends to bring a sobering dose of reality to the often cloud-bound Bwana.\n\nThe villains are solid enough, but they don't leave quite as strong of a mark as our hero does. That's fine, of course, it's just that when a game reminds you so much of a Lucasarts adventure, you start expecting all of their staples to appear, and one of those things is a big, scenery-chomping villain. I've already mentioned the great side characters, but I'm going to bring them up again, because they're worth it. Even though their parts are generally very small, just about every character you run into has some kind of quirk that virtually guarantees you'll remember them. That's not an easy thing to do properly.\n\nAs long as you're okay with the genre, there isn't much to complain about in The Journey Down: Chapter Two. The pace slows down a little bit too much in certain sections, and there are a couple of puzzles where you basically have to brute force them, but when I find an adventure game that doesn't suffer similarly, I'll come back and admonish this game more for it. The length is great, both the amount and variety of puzzles are superb, the presentation is stunning, the characters are charming, and the story is compelling. The only grievous complaint I can levy against it is that we have to wait again for a while to get the ending of the story. If the third chapter keeps up the quality found here, the whole game stitched together will likely be one of the best traditional adventure games of the last decade or more. Don't let it slip by you.", "wordchoice": ["reality", "don", "separated", "sense", "small", "were", "off", "completely", "is", "to", "or", "is"], "title": "The Journey Down: Chapter Two Review"}, {"url": "http://toucharcade.com/2014/09/10/dragon-quest-i-review/", "corpus": "Reviewing a game like Dragon Quest [$2.99] is never easy. First of all, as many of you probably do, I have a very deep childhood connection to this game, which means it's a nostalgic trip for me every time I play it. Then there's the fact that this is a genre-defining game, and as a result, can't possibly be expected to be as refined as the games that followed in the path it carved out. Ultimately, this game is both a classic and a curio, a piece of history that feels like one, no matter how much Square Enix tries to pretty it up. Its age is in its fundamental structure. I think it holds up very well relative to other games from its era, but that's perhaps faint praise, given the state of console RPGs in 1986. A completely new player without any sort of fondness for the history of the series would be better off checking out Dragon Quest 4 [$14.99] first. That doesn't mean that the first Dragon Quest has nothing to offer, but it's probably not the best way to break the ice in 2014.\n\nAs usual, though, a little bit of history first. This is the game originally known to many an English gamer as Dragon Warrior, a title adopted to avoid legal conflicts with TSR, the then-owners of Dungeons & Dragons. A lot of North American kids had this in their NES libraries, though precious few actually handed over money at a shop for it. Nintendo, the American publisher, widely overestimated the game's potential sales and were left with tons of unsold cartridges. These were distributed as a free bonus for subscribing to Nintendo Power, something a heck of a lot of kids were doing anyway. Nintendo would take a more careful approach in publishing their next overseas RPG hope, Final Fantasy [$8.99], but given Dragon Quest's notoriety, it's easy to see why Nintendo was bullish on it.\n\nContrary to popular lore, Dragon Quest was not the actual first JRPG. It might be accurate to say it was the first really good one, however, and it certainly set down a blueprint that the genre followed. By the time Dragon Quest began development, games like the pen and paper Dungeons & Dragons, Ultima, and Wizardry were all fairly popular with a certain subset of Japanese gamers, along with Henk Rogers' The Black Onyx and Falcom's Dragon Slayer games. Dragon Quest series creator Yuji Horii enjoyed those games, and wanted to make a more accessible game along similar lines. Grabbing the menu system from his previous adventure game Portopia Serial Murders, the overhead exploration of Ultima, the first-person battles of Wizardry, the artist from the then-recent manga Dragon Ball, and television composer Koichi Sugiyama, Yuji Horii put together his game that would change everything.\n\nThe idea was to simplify the extremely complex systems of RPGs, but still offer the player the satisfying feeling of following the story of a character who becomes stronger the more you play. That's just what Horii did, cutting away things like party members and job classes, leaving just a single hero with a simple goal: Defeat that jerk on the other side of the lake who's ruining things for everyone. Granted, getting to the other side of the lake involves a trip around the world, but it wouldn't be much fun if the hero just built a canoe or something, would it? That's basically the game, though. You travel clockwise around the world, sniff out a few magical items, rescue a princess, get to level 17 or 19 depending on how bold you are, and knock off the evil Dragonlord.\n\nIt's not a very long game by modern standards, and its even shorter in its current form. In its original form, Dragon Quest involved a lot of grinding. The game is basically unwinnable without the spell you get at level 17, so no matter how fast or slowly you reached the final castle, you still had to get yourself up to level 17. You also needed to grind to afford the gear necessary for survival. From the Super Famicom remakes onward, the enemies in Dragon Quest give a much better experience point and gold reward, reducing most of the need for grinding. With that drudgery removed, the game is over in mere hours if you know where you're going. I'd be awfully surprised if anyone took longer than 10 hours to get to the end, and most will finish well before that.\n\nClearly, Horii's plan to make the genre less intimidating to the average player went over very well, and later games in the series were able to slowly build complexity. It's probably impossible to overestimate what this game did for the genre, and that makes it a very important game. Important games are not always good in a modern context, though. Dragon Quest is still a very enjoyable game for me, and I replay it fairly often, but I'm not sure how much of that is on the game's lasting merits and how much is just my own nostalgia. It's all very sound, if very primitive, and certain elements, like Akira Toriyama's spectacular monster designs and Sugiyama's wonderful music, haven't aged a day. Other things haven't aged as gracefully.\n\nThere are no elements of customization whatsoever to your character. The list of equipment is very small and really just consists of stuff in each new town being better than the stuff in the last town. Battles offer very little strategy. You're either strong enough to survive, or you're not. If you're not, you have little recourse but to level up more or buy new gear. The closest thing to battle tactics you have at your disposal is the ability to put enemies to sleep. Abuse that, by the way, it works a wonder in this game. There are no subquests, few characters to speak of, and a whole lot of old-school design in locating the key items needed to beat the game. It's not a particularly friendly game by modern standards, which is kind of funny given its design roots.\n\nThis particular port is based on a Japan-only feature phone version, itself a remake of the Game Boy remake of the Super Famicom remake of the original. Phew, that's a lot of remaking. Mechanically, it's not too different from the last version we saw in English, the Game Boy Dragon Warrior I & II collection. You can save your game anywhere in the field log, as opposed to the original only allowing you to save with the king in the starting castle. Experience point and gold yields are adjusted as in that version to smooth out the grinding. There are lots of ease-of-use changes so that you don't have to go fishing in the menu constantly. The control interface will be familiar to anyone who played the iOS versions of Dragon Quest 4 and Dragon Quest 8 [$14.99], and the graphics are completely different from any prior version.\n\nThey're very grainy, with sharp pixelated edges on everything, and I personally think it looks a lot worse than the Super Famicom version, but obviously a lot more rich and detailed than the NES original. The controls are a bit fussy since the original game is strictly tile-based, but they're manageable enough once you get the hang of them. Like the other iOS Dragon Quest games, the game can only be played in portrait mode. I understand the reasoning and I personally prefer this mode, but I think Square Enix would be wise to consider providing options for those who would rather play in landscape. It's probably the most frequent complaint I see about these versions.\n\nThe translation is quite interesting. While they opted to use neither the original NES translation nor the Game Boy one, it pays strong homage to the style of the original Dragon Warrior. Naming conventions have been reverted, so for example, the legendary hero Loto, who had his name changed to Erdrick in the NES version and went back to Loto in the GB version, is now once again known as Erdrick. Moreover, the whole game uses an old English style, but far more accurately than the original English version. I kind of like that they did this, because I think for a lot of people with fond memories of the game, that unique style of translation is something that stands out.\n\nDragon Quest is many things. It's historically important, simple, fun, archaic, esoteric, nostalgia-inducing, genre-defining, focused, and mercifully brief. This port is decent enough, if not ideal, thanks to the somewhat-messy graphical style and the fiddly controls, which will be a much bigger problem come Dragon Quest 2, I promise. The price is, I suppose, about right for what Dragon Quest is. A classic, a museum piece, a nostalgia trip, and a reminder of just how much things can change, for better or worse, over the course of more than 25 years of game design advances. I think it's a game best experienced in portable format these days, but even with that in mind, it's still really only for those looking for a return to the most simple of times.", "wordchoice": ["actual", "it", "the", "was", "worse", "you", "the", "lot", "like", "checking", "field", "or"], "title": "Dragon Quest I Review"}, {"url": "http://toucharcade.com/2014/09/10/new-iphone-games-out-now-3/", "corpus": "Strap in boys, it's Wednesday night, and Jared has been busy doing mysterious things that could potentially pertain to iOS games in San Francisco all day.

Belli son belli, ma chiaramente, come ogni prodotto Apple, costano e anche tanto. Per questo motivo e per il lancio posticipato in Italia, molti stanno pensando di acquistare iPhone 6 all\u2019estero. Ma vale davvero la pena? Facciamo chiarezza.\n\nL\u2019iPhone 6 e l\u2019iPhone 6 Plus non dovrebbero presentare problemi con le schede italiane, a prescindere dal luogo in cui si acquisteranno i dispositivi. Tra l\u2019altro, la copertura LTE nel nostro Paese \u00e8 ancora parziale e non tutte le bande sono supportate. L\u2019unico particolare a cui fare attenzione \u00e8 quello di non acquistare i modelli A1586 e A1524, poich\u00e9 questi supportano varianti differenti di LTE. Se volete acquistare un iPhone all\u2019estero, allora cercate i modelli A1549 (iPhone 6 GSM) e A1522 (iPhone 6 Plus) per dormire sonni tranquilli.", "wordchoice": ["svelato", "A1586", "problemi", "Belli", "fare", "6", "due", "acquisteranno", "i", "LTE", "questi", "presentare"], "title": "Comprare iPhone 6 e iPhone 6 Plus all\u2019estero: quanto costano e quando saranno disponibili?"}, {"url": "http://www.iphone-girl.jp/2014/09/377395/", "corpus": "\u3010\u901f\u5831\u3011Apple\u306e\u65b0\u88fd\u54c1\u767a\u8868\u306f9\u67089\u65e5\u306b\u6c7a\u5b9a \u201cWish we could say m\u2026", "wordchoice": ["could", "m", "say", "we", "could", "we", "could", "say", "say", "m", "Apple\u306e\u65b0\u88fd\u54c1\u767a\u8868\u306f9\u67089\u65e5\u306b\u6c7a\u5b9a", "Apple\u306e\u65b0\u88fd\u54c1\u767a\u8868\u306f9\u67089\u65e5\u306b\u6c7a\u5b9a"], "title": "\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30a2\u5404\u793e\u3001iPhone6/6Plus\u306e\u4e88\u7d04\u306f9\u670812\u65e5\uff08\u91d1\uff0916\u6642\u304b\u3089"}]

Newsmosaic is an experiment in immersive newsfeed interface. Where many newsfeeds present their users with article snippets to browse by scrolling down, this experiments with fitting more articles on a single page to browse.

Some stuff to still explore:
- see "scatter/gather clustering", a topic in document browsing. I suppose this would be a kind of visual, manual scatter/gather clustering.

- To run, install python dependencies... (list not finalized)
- Data to populate frontend is stored in data.json for now. Will eeventually migrate to hosted db.
- Changes since hiatus: keyword extraction with Tagger. Bad things that have happened since Tagger: realized that flashing keywords might not be practical for multiword keywords... imagined changes to view to come.

Tokyo\u2014where snow is rare\u2014was brought to a standstill by just two inches. But many other places in the country have adapted to much greater accumulation, of the kind that appeared this week, for example, in Hokkaido and Hokuriku (three feet); Tohuku and Tokai (around two feet); and in Chogoku, Kanto, and Koshin (around a foot and a half).\n\nIn much of Japan, that kind of snow\u2014the kind that is currently producing headlines on the East Coast\u2014is not uncommon. Japan has the most ski resorts outside of the United States, festivals for building ice sculptures and snow shrines, and a website dedicated to the art of shoveling snow. (\u201c[Snow removal] is not a labor, it is an exercise!\u201d) Snow even gives an entire region\u2014known as \u201csnow country\u201d\u2014its nickname. In these hilly, mountainous areas, visitors can see Japanese macaques, or \u201csnow monkeys,\u201d bathing in hot springs, and traverse alpine corridors that are carved out in the winter to make them passable: On the Tateyama Kurobe route, the walls can reach up to 65 feet.\n\nPeople in \u201csnow country\u201d have developed snow-management techniques that would be the envy of the Eastern Seaboard. A 2006 New York Times article about Tsunan, in Niigata, described some of them, leading off with the story of a woman exiting her house through a \u201csecond-story window.\u201d\n\nThe \u201csprinklers installed in the middle of the street\u201d are shosetsu (snow-melting) pipes, which eject warm groundwater onto the surface of the street. More recently developed methods involve heating roads by circulating hot water below the pavement with the help of solar power that is stored in the summer. Another snow-management system is the ryusetsuko, a channel of river water that runs alongside roads and carries chunks of snow away. Houses in snowy areas have steep roofs to make snow slide down them\u2014although sometimes, according to Snow Engineering: Recent Advances, \u201cdeep snow accumulated on the ground reaches the snow on the roof, interfering with the sliding of snow off the roof.\u201d (Japanese use old-fashioned snow-clearing\u2014josetsu\u2014techniques as well, meaning hands and heavy machinery.)\n\nJapan\u2019s innovations seem a wise response to the quirks of the country\u2019s geography. In an introduction to the English translation of the novel Snow Country, by the Nobel Prize-winning Japanese author Yasunari Kawabata, the Japanese literature scholar Edward Seidensticker explains the phenomenon: \u201cIn the winter, cold winds blow down from Siberia, pick up moisture over the Japan Sea, and drop it as snow when they strike the mountains of Japan.\u201d\n\nThe result is \u201canomalous\u201d amounts of snow on Hokkaido, Japan\u2019s northernmost island, and on the western coast of Honshu, Japan\u2019s largest, where the moist air mass runs into the Japanese Alps in the middle of the island. (This process is similar to what creates \u201clake-effect snow\u201d in the United States.) Because of those mountains, the Pacific-facing side of Honshu, where it rarely snows, stays dry, like the front of a person lying on her back in fresh powder. Per Seidensticker: \u201cThe west coast of the main island of Japan is probably for its latitude \u2026 the snowiest region in the world.\u201d\n\nSo how much snow does that entail? According to the Japanese Meteorological Association, enough to break records: On February 14, 1927, 1,182 centimeters of snow\u2014nearly 39 feet\u2014were recorded on Mount Ibuki. On January 23, 2016, the JMA recorded almost eight feet in Sankeyu, Aomori Prefecture, in northern Honshu. The highest-recorded snowfall there is 18 and a half feet, in February 2013. (The measurements have only been made since 1979.) The same year, Eric Hansen, reporting for Outside from Niseko, Hokkaido, a popular skiing destination, described a \u201cmonth-long, uninterrupted storm\u201d that left almost 15 feet in January.\n\nThe Japanese government monitors snow depth in certain regions and designates them either \u201cheavy snowfall areas\u201d or \u201cspecial heavy snowfall areas,\u201d which are more extreme. In all, they make up about 50 percent of Japan, and their population has been steadily decreasing. Kyu-Shirataki, Hokkaido, where Japan Railways keeps a train station open to serve a single passenger, shows one example of such depopulation. When it snows\u2014Kyu-Shirataki is in a special heavy snowfall area\u2014the local government must decide whether to spend money on removing snow in the most remote areas for a dwindling and often elderly population.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that despite Japan\u2019s advances, it remains difficult to live in a place where several feet of snow is normal: According to the author of the Snow Engineering study, \u201cVarious types of labor peculiar to snow country and unrelated to productivity \u2026 are needed. When I consider these alone, living in snow country can be said to be disadvantageous, as compared to living outside snow country.\u201d\n\nBut snow country has pulled off at least one miracle.\n\n\u201cOver the 50 years this airport has been open, a failure to clear snow has never resulted in a flight cancellation.\u201d Masato Kanazawa, the director of the airport in Aomori prefecture\u2014where there's now eight feet of snow on the ground in some places\u2014said that in 2014.

It\u2019s long been discredited, or at least floated back down to earth. For one, English has more than one word for snow\u2014powder, flurry, pack, slush, hail, sleet, ice, black ice, and so on. And for another, the structure of the Eskimo-Aleut languages is more conducive to producing multiple \u201cwords\u201d for snow.\n\nLinguists call languages like the Eskimo polysynthetic. In synthetic languages, words are formed from smaller semantic parts. In polysynthetic languages words get composed out of many smaller parts, sometimes truly bonkers numbers of smaller parts.

It has housed a diverse assortment of the country\u2019s dissidents, businessmen, Islamists, and statesmen\u2014including the ousted president Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt for nearly three decades before his regime fell in the uprising that began almost exactly five years ago.\n\nSince then, the upheaval hasn\u2019t stopped, and it\u2019s as much personal as it is collective. The country saw its first-ever democratic elections; another wave of protest over the rule of Mohammed Morsi, the Islamist president those elections brought to power; a military coup, led by then-Army Chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi; and a reinstatement, under now-President Sisi, of the kind of authoritarianism protesters risked their lives to escape five years ago. The crackdown has ensnared liberals and Islamists alike, leaving the prison as a burial chamber for the aspirations of the revolution, in all their wide variety.\n\n9 Faces of the New Egypt\n\nNourhan Hefzy has memorized the way there. The route winds through Faisal\u2019s trash-strewn maze of narrow streets and past the more manicured fringes of Cairo, beyond the French School and the boutiques. It ends at a sepia-toned compound of cement in a bleak, brown desert. Somewhere inside that compound is her husband, Ahmed. He has been locked away there for the past two years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been five years since we\u2019ve toppled Mubarak and we\u2019re back to square one,\u201d Nourhan says. At 26, Ahmed was one of Egypt\u2019s most prominent liberal activists, and remains a living symbol of the revolution: once vibrant and triumphant on Cairo\u2019s streets, now languid and silenced behind bars. The young couple used to talk for hours about their plans to open a bookstore, maybe even start a publishing house dedicated to fostering freedom and democracy in a country with a severe deficit of both. Now their conversations are limited to a hurried, supervised 20 minutes every other week.\n\n\u201cIt is worse than square one,\u201d corrects Ahmed\u2019s mother Fathia, who often accompanies her daughter-in-law on visits to El Sijn. For her, the journey to the prison evokes a more-distant past, after her father and almost all her male relatives were arrested decades ago for being members of the then-banned Islamist Muslim Brotherhood. The organization, whose political party was briefly in charge of Egypt\u2019s government following Morsi\u2019s ascent to the presidency, has once again been banned. But Fathia never thought her son\u2014a staunch critic of the very group she and her husband have dedicated their lives to\u2014would also end up behind bars.\n\nAmnesty International and other human-rights groups have called Sisi\u2019s crackdown unprecedented. Security forces have targeted Morsi\u2019s supporters and accused the Brotherhood of coordinating with far more radical Islamist groups that have killed hundreds of police and soldiers in the Sinai Peninsula, including one that pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2014. The Brotherhood denies any affiliation. Egypt\u2019s Ministry of Interior has reported that 11,877 people were arrested on terrorism charges between January and September 2015, though it has released no updated numbers since.\n\nBut the state\u2019s tentacles have spread to strangle any dissent. A protest law passed in November 2013 has become, as Amnesty International describes it, \u201ca fast track\u201d to prison. According to the most recent data available from the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, since Morsi\u2019s ouster 41,000 people had been arrested, charged, or indicted with a criminal offence as of May 2014.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not with the military regime, you\u2019re a terrorist. But once you lift the terrorist title you see people you know ... your son, your husband, the grocer down the street ... everyone,\u201d Fathia says. \u201cThe country is divided. ... No one knows what is next.\u201d\n\nThe repression has been intensifying ahead of the fifth anniversary of the revolt\u2019s beginning on January 25; security forces have recently arrested activists and shut down cultural spaces, including a popular art gallery\u2014one of the few bastions of creative community\u2014in downtown Cairo.\n\n\u201cWe are now facing the worst, most oppressive time in modern Egyptian history,\u201d says Gamal Eid, a leading Egyptian human-rights lawyer and activist. \u201c[T]he freedom of those behind bars is our own freedom.\u201d\n\nFive years after Egypt\u2019s popular uprising began and briefly triumphed, here are the stories of five families from across Egypt\u2019s scarred political spectrum, united by their grief over a revolution that devoured its children. Their stories form a tattered scrapbook of one of the most tumultuous periods in the region\u2019s modern history.\n\nIt took awhile for Fathia to warm up to Nourhan, the wife of her oldest son. For one thing, she\u2019s unveiled. Fathia, who has lived in a conservative Nile Delta village her whole life, says she was worried what other people would say. \u201cIn our family we would consider a man who lets his woman dress like this as not in control of his house,\u201d she explains.\n\nNourhan is also a self-described liberal activist who, despite growing up in a conservative Cairo neighborhood, was allowed to have boys as friends and pursue drama in school. Fathia comes from a family of staunch Muslim Brotherhood supporters in the countryside. In communities like theirs, long neglected by Mubarak\u2019s regime, the Muslim Brotherhood provided a range of social services such as health clinics and nursery schools. Fathia\u2019s family benefitted from and strengthened that network; they built their neighborhood\u2019s first mosque and volunteered weekly. For Fathia and her husband, the organization \u201csignifies what it means to be a Muslim. It\u2019s about caring for all.\u201d Nourhan rolls her eyes at this.\n\nFathia notes generational differences\u2014\u201cthis generation wants to live their life, in their own style\u201d\u2014 but there\u2019s more to the family\u2019s dispute. Ahmed, she says, has always questioned authority. In February 2015, he was sentenced to life in prison as part of Sisi\u2019s crackdown. But by then he was no stranger to prison. He had been jailed under Mubarak and then Morsi as well. He was first arrested in 2009 at the border of the Gaza Strip along with other activists expressing solidarity with Palestinians.\n\nAt the time, Nourhan says, the Muslim Brotherhood refused to defend him, even though the group often uses the siege of Gaza as one of its political rallying cries. The experience changed Ahmed. From then on, he considered the organization he grew up with to be \u201chypocrites,\u201d if not enemies.\n\nHe was released that time. Nourhan met him shortly afterward, in 2010, at a Palestinian solidarity demonstration. They fell in love almost immediately. On the night Mubarak was ousted\u2014February 11, 2011\u2014they held their engagement party in Tahrir Square. But Ahmed wasn\u2019t done protesting. After the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s political wing and other Islamist parties took more than two-thirds of seats in parliament, and eventually the presidency, following the country\u2019s first post-revolutionary elections in 2012, Ahmed foresaw yet another autocracy in the making. He criticized Morsi\u2019s government for pushing a religiously conservative agenda and for not holding the military accountable for violence against protesters.\n\nAhmed was again arrested in 2012, this time for, among other things, spraying anti-Morsi graffiti around the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters, and again released fairly soon. But his father, a Brotherhood supporter, publicly agreed with Ahmed\u2019s punishment. \u201cThis caused a chasm between us and Ahmed,\u201d Fathia recalls. \u201cNourhan started to feel that she and Ahmed belong to one team, and that we belong to different team.\u201d\n\nOn June 30, 2013, Ahmed was among millions who demonstrated for Morsi to step down and hold early elections. On July 3, he cheered along with much of the country when the military ousted him. His father told him then that the country\u2019s youth were being foolish, that the \u201cdeep state\u201d\u2014the entrenched centers of authority among Egyptian bureaucrats and security forces\u2014would prevail. More than two years later, many think he was right. Ahmed is again behind bars. His father keeps a low profile in his Nile Delta village, fearful of being abducted or arrested at any time, like so many of his relatives and friends.\n\nBut despite sharing an enemy in the form of the \u201cdeep state,\u201d the family remains divided by a deep sense of mistrust. \u201cAt any moment the Muslim Brotherhood is capable of doing anything in the name of religion, or in the name of the organization, to defend themselves,\u201d Nourhan says. \u201cUnfortunately, my relationships with all the members around me only deepened my views.\u201d\n\nFathia doesn\u2019t retort. Instead, she recalls the recent wedding of her younger son, who wanted to wait until Ahmed got out of prison to get married. When Ahmed was handed a life sentence, he decided not to wait any longer.\n\n\u201cI was so distracted by Ahmed\u2019s absence at the wedding that I couldn\u2019t even notice my other son who was getting married,\u201d says Fathia, her face folding into tears.\n\nNourhan reaches over to touch her arm. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, mother,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\nShe hands Fathia a tissue, but not before using it to wipe her own tears.\n\nEsraa el-Taweel returns to her cramped Cairo apartment for the first time after six months in prison. It\u2019s largely as she left it, filled with the traces of a normal 23-year-old life turned upside down in just one evening.\n\nThere\u2019s her beloved cat, Woody, who had kittens while she was gone. There\u2019s the treadmill she used for physical therapy after she was shot by a police officer (and nearly paralyzed) in 2014, during third-anniversary celebrations for the January 25 Revolution. Then there\u2019s what her 22-year-old sister, Doaa, calls her \u201cheart\u201d: two Canon cameras, which she has used to document the past five years.\n\n\u201cEsraa never cost Egypt anything,\u201d her mother Hana said last summer, while Esraa was still imprisoned. \u201cYet Egypt took the most valuable thing from her: her freedom.\u201d\n\nEsraa was accused of belonging to the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood and of publishing false reports that \u201cdistort Egypt\u2019s reputation\u201d\u2014charges she denies. In December, the Cairo Criminal Court released her for medical reasons, but the charges remain, and her movements are still restricted and monitored. She\u2019s not allowed to talk to the press.\n\n\u201cEl kaboos,\u201d as Esraa\u2019s sister and mother call it\u2014Egyptian Arabic for \u201cthe nightmare\u201d\u2014began one humid evening last June. Esraa and two of her best friends, Omar Mohammed and Suhaib Saad, went to Chili\u2019s, the Cairo outpost of the American restaurant chain, and never made it back home.\n\n\u201cThe days were long and we all had nightmares. Is she alive? Did someone kill her?\u201d recalled Doaa. \u201cWe waited 17 days until we found out she was detained.\u201d\n\nShe and her friends had been seized by plain-clothes police officers outside the restaurant, but Egyptian security forces repeatedly told Esraa\u2019s family and their lawyers that they weren\u2019t holding her. Hana said some even scolded her for letting her daughter go out with two male friends, and suggested that Esraa had run off with a lover.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Esraa\u2019s father went on television to talk about his missing girl that someone gave the family a tip through Facebook: A woman said she had seen Esraa at a prison for women in Cairo. Like many Egyptian young people, Esraa had protested against Sisi\u2019s human-rights abuses and tweeted criticisms of his rule, Doaa says\u2014nothing that warranted detainment. \u201cIf a nearly crippled girl is a threat, then it can be any of us.\u201d\n\nHuman-rights activists say Esraa\u2019s \u201cenforced disappearance\u201d is a part of a wave of arrests in which security forces have detained dozens of people without disclosing their location, in effect hiding them from the law. Freedom for the Brave, an independent group offering support to detainees, reported that it had documented over 375 such cases since April 2015, though other groups put that number anywhere between 160 and 1,500. Esraa\u2019s friends Saad and Mohammed were referred to a military trial on similar charges in late August. Saad\u2019s brother says Saad was coerced into confessing on tape to transporting weapons, and that he was hung by his wrists for three days and electrocuted.\n\n\u201cPrison is a wicked thing, life is losing its meaning; more accurately there is no life here. We are like the living dead,\u201d Esraa wrote in a letter that Doaa managed to smuggle out of the prison during a visit. In the first 15 days of her detainment, Esraa said she was blindfolded and forced to listen to the screams of men being tortured. \u201cAt the end of the tunnel, life gives us light, it lets us forget the pain we suffered greatly. \u2026 Oh God, when will this nightmare end.\u201d\n\nOver the course of her imprisonment, Esraa\u2019s ability to walk deteriorated. Doaa rarely smiles and can barely muster the interest to finish her last year of university. Their younger sister, Alaa, has dropped out of school. Their mother says she can\u2019t bring herself to scold her. Why plan for a future in a country where a night at Chili\u2019s can usher in months of sorrow?\n\nLast summer, Hana said that as soon as Esraa got out of prison, the family would pack their bags and leave the country. But now that Esraa is out, there\u2019s no way to leave. They must wait. Until the verdict comes in or until the charges are dropped or until ... they don\u2019t know what.\n\nUntil then, celebratory balloons hang from the ceiling of Esraa\u2019s apartment. Her two cameras still sit in her bedroom, layered with a thick coat of dust even though she\u2019s back home.\n\nSaleh Taher grew up in the backstreets of Awayed, a poor neighborhood on the edge of Alexandria, never really understanding politics. A member of \u201cHezb al-Kanaba,\u201d the couch party\u2014a term for Egypt\u2019s silent majority that sat out the revolution at home\u2014 Saleh says she has never really even watched the news. In her version of Egypt, 2011 was just another year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a politically interested family,\u201d she explains as we sit in her living room with her husband and oldest son. \u201cWe don\u2019t like politics.\u201d\n\nBut now they\u2019re tangled in and strangled by it.\n\nIn January 2014, Saleh\u2019s 21-year-old son Mohammed Emam was shot in the leg during a demonstration at the University of Alexandria. That April, he was arrested following a protest at the university.\n\nWhile his mother denies that her son is an activist, his friends say Mohammed is part of the April 6 Youth Movement\u2014a group that helped organize the mass protests that toppled Mubarak in February 2011. In April 2014, a court banned the movement, accusing it of \u201cespionage\u201d and \u201cactivities that distort Egypt's image.\u201d One pro-government lawyer accused the group of being a \u201cterrorism organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know what April 6 is,\u201d Saleh says. She often mistakes the name and confuses the group\u2019s prominent leaders\u2014evidence, she says, of her family\u2019s ignorance and her son\u2019s innocence.\n\nNothing is wrong in Egypt, she says. They\u2019re just a normal family, she says. They just go about their business, she says. \u201cWe\u2019re only concerned about the health of our son.\u201d\n\nMohammed\u2019s imprisonment is complicated for the family. His father is a retired military officer. \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to get involved in politics,\u201d is all he\u2019ll say.\n\nTheir oldest son Tamer, a 36-year-old accountant, hesitates to criticize the regime, fearful of making the case against his brother worse. \u201cI think any blind man can see the issue,\u201d he finally says. \u201cThere are major transgressions happening in the country and it\u2019s the fault of the person who is in charge.\u201d\n\nFrom the opposite end of the room, the father clicks his tongue in disapproval.\n\nSaleh laughs nervously, tightening her pink headscarf. \u201cThat\u2019s his business,\u201d his father says when asked about Tamer\u2019s opinion. He has yet to visit his son in prison. \u201cMe, I don\u2019t have any opinions about all this.\u201d\n\nMai says she has aged 50 years in the past five. When the revolution started, the aspiring violinist was only 15. She didn\u2019t know what was happening or what was at stake. She had grown up in Alexandria and had never been to Cairo. She still hasn\u2019t. But now at 20, she says she has seen it all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a child anymore,\u201d she declares, sitting in a caf\u00e9 on Alexandria\u2019s glistening Mediterranean coastline. \u201cNo one is a child anymore.\u201d\n\nAlong with her childhood, she has lost friends over political differences. She has lost others through death. She witnessed the killings of two friends, who were met with live ammunition at her university where they were protesting for more rights.\n\nShe\u2019s also lost her sense of place. To see her 28-year-old older brother, Loay, she must now wake up at dawn and travel to Alexandria\u2019s Borg El Arab prison, where he\u2019s been serving a two-year sentence. She waits for up to five hours in \u201cdisgusting conditions\u201d to see him for a rushed 20 minutes.\n\n\u201cLoay says the situation is so bad now in Egypt that being in prison is actually better, because if he were out, he would do something reckless or radical,\u201d she says. \u201cHe would keep protesting and never go back until he\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nIn February 2015, Loay and others were sentenced to two years in prison, for charges including protesting without authorization and threatening public security. After an appeal, the verdict was reduced in May to one year and three months. Loay was already in prison, serving time in another case of protesting without permission outside the Alexandria Criminal Court in December 2013, while it was retrying two police officers accused of killing 18-year-old Khaled Said. Said died in June 2010 after being beaten by police officers. His death is considered a major catalyst for the 2011 revolution.\n\nLoay knew Said and was part of a tight-knit group of Alexandrian activists who were protesting against Mubarak\u2019s regime long before the revolution. From an early age, Loay was frustrated by the country\u2019s poor education system, high unemployment, and corruption.\n\nMai, a relatively conservative, veiled university student who shuns political labels, was never very close to her older brother, who would read Marx instead of the Quran, smoke cigarettes, and hang out with his \u201ccomrades,\u201d including unveiled girls. Loay considers himself a revolutionary socialist\u2014his Twitter bio reads, \u201cIn gloom, we bloom\u201d\u2014and he was an outsider in an otherwise conservative family. One of their cousins is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and is currently in prison.\n\n\u201cNow that Loay is in prison, I actually see him more,\u201d Mai says. \u201cWe\u2019ve become friends through the experience. I\u2019ve learned a lot from him, and I\u2019ve grown.\u201d She has bonded with other families of those behind bars, forming a kind of network with members of different segments of Egyptian society\u2014including one of Alexandria\u2019s most prominent Islamists, who was imprisoned along with Loay and recently released.\n\n\u201cIn the past, before all this, I would have never talked to people like him or people different than me,\u201d she says. \u201cThis experience completely changed me, and though my world is still small, it\u2019s bigger.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something she says Loay had been trying to instill in her since she was a child.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid, I used to hate cockroaches. Whenever I saw one in the house, I\u2019d scream and immediately try to kill it,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut Loay would take it and put it outside, instructing me to do the same.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Just because you hate it, doesn\u2019t give you the right to kill it,\u2019 he\u2019d say. \u2018Just because you hate it, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t live with it.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the past six months, whenever Rawda has wanted to see or talk to her father, she must wait for a call from an unknown number. She then travels from her Nile Delta village to a clandestine location around Cairo, where he changes his residence once every few weeks.\n\nIn October 2013, he was arrested for being a member of the Brotherhood. After two and half years behind bars, he was released. But his freedom was short-lived. He soon heard there was another order for his arrest. He hit the road immediately.\n\n\u201cHe had opportunities to flee the country and be free,\u201d the 20-year-old law student says. \u201cBut if everyone fled, who would stay and fight? Who would stay and continue the struggle? When you believe in a just cause, it gives you strength to go on.\u201d\n\nHer father had been a leading Muslim Brotherhood figure since she was young. Under Mubarak, he had been arrested for his involvement in the group in 2005, 2007, and 2010, but never for longer than 15 days. This was the norm for many of her friends\u2019 fathers. \u201cThe Brotherhood isn\u2019t just an organization,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of life.\u201d\n\nGrowing up, Rawda says the organization was all she knew, but she didn\u2019t strongly identify with it. And during Morsi\u2019s rule, she even criticized them for taking too much control.\n\n\u201cI felt that he wasn\u2019t fulfilling his promises to the revolution,\u201d she explains. \u201cEveryone makes mistakes like any other group, and I wanted more room to criticize him.\u201d\n\nBut in 2013, her lukewarm allegiance boiled to impassioned dedication when security forces killed up to 1,000 supporters of the ousted Islamist president in Midan Rabaa al-Adawiyya, a public square in eastern Cairo, who had been occupying the square for 47 days. Human Rights Watch has described the event as \u201cone of the world\u2019s largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a blood ghost following me ever since,\u201d she says, barely able to finish her sentence. \u201cI can\u2019t shake the sights of that day.\u201d She has been in therapy for the past few years but still suffers from panic attacks whenever she is near the square.\n\nWhile Rawda says the Muslim Brotherhood has moved back underground, they\u2019re as committed as ever. They hold their weekly meetings in secret locations and have appointed a new local leadership. Still, everyone knows she is associated with the group, and she fears she could be expelled from her university at any time. Every two weeks she and her friends hold small demonstrations there, but they feel powerless to effect any real change.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, everything but nothing has changed,\u201d she says. Nine months ago, she decided to wear the niqab, a veil that covers the face. Her father advised her not to\u2014for fear of rising national sentiment against Islamists\u2014but she insisted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my way of saying I\u2019m going to be who I want to be,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s my choice. It\u2019s my right.\u201d She also expresses herself on Facebook, posting a torrent of pleas for people to remember the jailed and detained, for the country to \u201cwake up.\u201d Recently, she posted an image of a ballerina\u2019s feet, the left one wrapped in an elegant slipper, the right one bare but for bandages, bruises, and sores. It\u2019s a reminder, Rawda says, of the beauty that masks pain, of the pain that creates beauty.\n\nShe now wants to be a human-rights lawyer and has started working with the London-based Arab Organization for Human Rights. She documents arrests and contacts families of detainees.\n\n\u201cWhen Mubarak stepped down, it was a beautiful memory,\u201d she says, recalling protesting in Tahrir Square alongside her father. \u201cNow, all we have are the memories.\u201d\n\nThis story is part of a GroundTruth Project series called The Other, funded by The Ford Foundation.

I worked out at the gym regularly, and had missed hardly a day of work in over 35 years of teaching at Harvard. I loved my work and was obsessed, probably too obsessed, with it.\n\nAt the beginning of December I visited my primary-care physician to talk about a hernia that I had recently developed. Before meeting my doctor, a nurse weighed me at 147 pounds. I was virtually certain my weight the previous five years had fluctuated only one pound from 155. When my doctor came in, he confirmed I was right. Given my inclination to obsess about health risks and panic at the slightest hint of a problem, I felt a pang of fear: Wasn\u2019t unexplained weight loss a symptom of cancer? But the lab tests were normal. I went home and resolved to forget about it.\n\nFast forward a month. My wife was worried that I seemed tired and unfocused. While meeting with a Los Angeles city official over Christmas, I had fallen asleep. The day after returning to Boston, I was sitting near the window reading the newspaper. The vision in my right eye seemed slightly blurry, so I decided on a small experiment. Covering my left eye, I tried to read the newsprint. To my dismay it was illegible.\n\nBy coincidence, I had my annual physical exam the next morning. My doctor looked into the eye and said, \u201cYou need to see your eye doctor soon.\u201d Within the next twenty-four hours, I saw three doctors\u2014the eye doctor, a retina specialist, and an eye-inflammation specialist. It was amazing how quickly the second two doctors, whom I had never dealt with, saw me. The inflammation specialist told me the inflammation could have three causes: infection, auto-immune disease, or (least-likely) cancer in the eye. He drew some blood and scheduled a biopsy.\n\nThe test results would take days or even weeks to come, and the cancer tests were slowest. My eye doctor suggested a neuro-oncology consult, where they tested my cognitive functions (walking in a straight line, naming the last five presidents backwards), pronounced me normal, and scheduled an MRI that Friday to test further for cancer in the brain. With the normal cognition test and a negative preliminary biopsy for cancer that had just come in, I wasn\u2019t particularly worried.\n\nI was eating lunch, only hours after the MRI, when my cellphone rang. The person said my MRI showed \u201ca problem.\u201d I needed to get to the hospital pronto. The word \u201ccancer\u201d was not used, and I, somewhat catatonically, although without panic, headed for the subway and proceeded to the hospital.\n\nWhen I had checked in and saw a doctor, I quickly asked, \u201cIs there any benign explanation for these results?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said. The doctor didn\u2019t use the word, but it was clear I had cancer.\n\nNot surprisingly, much of this year for me since that short exchange has been dominated by cancer, and these are the topics of the rest of this essay. Some of what I learned taught good things about myself. The most surprising is that I did not fall apart in connection with my diagnosis or treatment. Why didn\u2019t I go into a tailspin, as I normally am wont to do at any hint of a medical problem? But I also confronted less-flattering things about myself, including not having paid enough attention to friends or neighbors, and not doing enough volunteering. Both were related to obsession with work. I needed to decide how, if at all, I would change my life in what would I hoped would be my post-cancer world.\n\nThe day after I checked into the hospital I got a PET scan to see whether the cancer had spread beyond my brain and right eye. The doctor told me the scan showed no spread. Then came more of what sounded like good news: My tumor was small and had been caught early. I smiled, and involuntarily patted the doctor on the back. Without waiting, she proceeded to tell me that I had lymphoma, and that while lymphoma is common, in the brain (central nervous system or CNS lymphoma) it was extremely rare.\n\nChemotherapy, she continued, was to begin the very next day. Chemo for lymphoma, she explained, was divided into two stages, \u201cinduction\u201d and \u201cconsolidation.\u201d Induction, which would take place in seven cycles every two weeks, was to get the tumor to recede. Consolidation was to prevent it from coming back.\n\nI couldn\u2019t quite follow what the doctor was saying, especially about the idea of two stages of treatment. The one question I managed was, \u201cWhy are there two stages of treatment for this cancer? Does that mean it has an unusual risk of recurring?\u201d Good question, I later realized. She didn\u2019t give a specific answer.\u00a0 \u201cYes, it can come back. But even if it comes back, it is often treatable. It is a lazy cancer that doesn\u2019t develop immunity to chemo. I have a patient in her eighties who has been treated for CNS lymphoma four times.\u201d There were two different kinds of consolidation treatments, she continued. One was a stronger round of chemo. The other was a new and promising, but risky, procedure called \u201cstem-cell transplantation.\u201d (I had no idea what this was.) I could decide later which I wanted.\n\nThe strangest feature, not only of those first days but for much of the year that followed, was how preternaturally calm I felt. I am amazed I did not fall apart in connection with my initial diagnosis or the months of treatment that followed.\n\nDuring the first days, part of it was the sheer speed of what was happening. The bad news came without warning, so I had no time to brood in advance. No sooner was I diagnosed than I was told treatment would more or less immediately begin. Then, a little bizarrely, the \u201cgood news\u201d showing no spread of the cancer almost cancelled out the bad news of the cancer itself. Based on my existing knowledge of cancer, this was promising in terms of my prospects; I should be able to defeat this.\n\nThis calm continued as I settled into routines that would replace my obsession with work and come to completely to dominate my life for the next five months: a rigorous schedule of treatments (chemo and otherwise) in the hospital and at home. These consumed my days and made me feel purposeful: I was fighting to get better. I adopted interim goals, including gaining back weight lost during my chemo and, more importantly, making the hard decision about whether I should get a stem-cell transplant afterwards.\n\nMy body had to be prepped in various ways to accept the chemo without adverse reactions. But I discovered the hospital had no procedures for starting\u00a0 these procedures immediately. At the beginning, my treatments therefore started very late at night, creating a risk I\u2019d have to stay in the hospital an unwanted extra day to give my system the chance it needed to recover. I improvised in a number of ways to get my treatment started earlier, but I wish I hadn\u2019t had to improvise.\n\nMy life at home also involved many routines around my illness. In the hospital, I would lose my appetite and several pounds. It took about two days at home to get my appetite back, giving me ten days between treatments for a forced march to retrieve lost weight. This struggle took on great importance in my daily life. I started with Carnation instant breakfasts with milk and ice cream (spiked with almond butter for calories and protein), tablespoons of whipped cream, and a milkshake-tasting drink that, my sister reminded me, my mother had given me as a skinny child. I ate two tablespoons of whipped cream with breakfast. I scarfed fatty foods, such as a tenderloin steak, which I otherwise never ate except occasionally at restaurants, and even downed previously verboten health horrors such as bacon, as well as fettuccine with cream and parmesan sauce. In addition to three meals, I ate two or three snacks a day (often yogurt or peanut butter), in-between breakfast and lunch, lunch and dinner, and after dinner. Finally, I had a\u00a0 smoothie every night before bed.\n\nEach morning I religiously weighed myself, and emailed my children and siblings with the results. (I discovered weight doesn\u2019t change on a linear path, but can be stable for a few days, suddenly spike upwards for no apparent reason, and even sometimes, also not necessarily for an apparent reason, spike down.)\n\nThe doctors worried about dehydration, so despite never liking water much,\u00a0 I had to force down liquids, starting with a bottle of water waking up every morning. I couldn\u2019t go outside during Boston\u2019s brutal winter, but I was told to walk, so I paraded up and back down the stairs several times, sometimes ten times daily. Once it got warmer, I would walk a mile and a half daily. Like a toddler, I took two naps a day.\n\nMy friends kept me busy by visiting often. There is no greater clich\u00e9 about how people react to serious illness than to note how it makes one appreciate the importance of friends. But clich\u00e9s become clich\u00e9s for a reason. I would not say that before getting sick I ignored my friends, but, obsessed with work, I didn\u2019t give them the attention they should have received. Treating me more generously than I deserved, people showered me with visits in the hospital and at home. Some brought me the few foods I found appetizing, such as pizza. One colleague regularly plied me with Sichuan fish, a taste that survived chemo. Neighbors from our block helped with food and support, far more than my previous attention to the neighborhood warranted.\n\nMy wife, who worked week days in another city when my treatment started, and my daughters, who also lived elsewhere, put in place an amazing logistics system for seeing friends. The only times I became tearful during these months came when I cried tears of joy in response to the kindness of friends and colleagues; I welled up uncontrollably when a class of executive-education students stood up and applauded when I came to Harvard for the first time in months to speak informally over lunch.\n\nThe other thing that kept me busy at home was learning more about my illness, by reading and drilling my doctors with questions. To be frank, my doctors didn\u2019t volunteer much information; I had to learn myself about my disease and about treatment options. But they were excellent at answering questions.\n\nAbout a month into treatment, I serendipitously learned two important pieces of information about my cancer. One afternoon a visiting college friend asked how I was being treated, and I casually answered I was receiving chemo. That\u2019s impossible, he replied: Chemo could not get into the brain because of the \u201cblood-brain barrier.\u201d He explained that the blood-brain barrier\u2014which I had never heard of\u2014had developed to protect the brain from foreign substances, and that this created a problem for a lymphoma, which unlike other cancers, couldn\u2019t be treated by chemo. Shortly thereafter, I received an email from the daughter of a family friend, a medical researcher. She quoted a just-published article on CNS lymphoma stating that 25 years ago, the disease was a death sentence, but through a series of medical advances, that was no longer true.\n\nAfter asking my doctors a barrage of questions, I learned that CNS lymphoma had previously been a death sentence because of the blood-brain barrier. That death sentence was partly lifted as doctors discovered that the chemo agent methotrexate, administered in high doses, could penetrate the brain. However, at these doses, it would likely cause severe kidney damage unless this was counteracted. This was the reason, I now learned, for why I had to be prepped before treatment could start and was constantly on intravenous fluids during my whole stay (which meant I needed to go to the bathroom every ten minutes).\n\nBut while this chemo could put the cancer in remission, it was unlikely to cure it. I soon learned that CNS lymphoma returns about 70 percent of the time, often within two years. The reason my initial \u201cgood news\u201d that the tumor had been caught early and hadn\u2019t spread didn\u2019t mean so much was that even small, localized tumors would likely recur.\n\nThis news launched a month of intensive effort to decide whether to risk receiving a stem-cell transplant. The basic idea of a transplant was simple, though the procedure has an air of medical magic. I would be given an extremely high dose of chemo over nine straight days, the goal of which was to kill any remaining cancer cells. However, this regimen was so severe it would also kill all of my white blood cells, which would leave me to die of infection\u2014unless I received the stem-cell transplant. This was the magic part: Before I received the chemo, stem cells living in my bone marrow, which specialize in producing white blood cells (not like the undifferentiated fetal stem cells about which there is political controversy) would be harvested and frozen. When the chemo was over, these stem cells would then be inserted back into my body, giving me new white blood cells. Afterwards, I\u2019d be at severe risk for infection for several months, as the white blood cells gradually began functioning.\n\nThe alternative to a transplant was a consolidation chemo that was less risky, but possibly less effective in preventing recurrence. As I started my decision-making process, I saw this as an extremely difficult decision, arguably the most difficult of my life. The treatment itself created a risk of death from infection (or from reactions to the strong chemo I would receive).\u00a0 How much would it reduce the risk my cancer would relapse? I was somewhat concerned my doctors were transplant evangelists, whose enthusiasm for technology maybe outran the evidence, a phenomenon familiar from my own academic area of public policy where advocates often became impervious to evidence. I was determined not only to read every scientific paper on transplants for CNS lymphoma but also to track down outside researchers who specialized in it. After doing exhaustive research, I would set up a meeting with my doctor to ask my remaining questions; I asked a friend if he could accompany me at that meeting as a devil\u2019s advocate, to shield me against evangelism.\n\nMy doctors provided three recently-published scientific papers on consolidation treatments for CNS lymphoma, two on transplants and one on the less-aggressive treatment. (Science was moving fast!) I also emailed three university-based experts on CNS lymphoma, and all agreed to talk.\n\nThe studies were imperfect. Ideally, researchers like \u201crandomized controlled trials,\u201d where people are randomly assigned to different treatments, or no treatment at all. Without randomization, healthier people might get transplants, and better results might be due to their being healthier rather than the treatment. But no randomized controlled trials for CNS lymphoma consolidation existed. I could only compare how many people getting transplants, however they were chosen, remained cancer-free compared with those getting less-aggressive consolidation or getting no consolidation at all. I knew at this point the probability of quick recurrence with no consolidation was very high. But I didn\u2019t know the comparison between a transplant and less-aggressive consolidation.\n\nWith my life at stake, I couldn\u2019t afford to be a purist; I had to decide based on the imperfect evidence available.\n\nThe studies seemed to tell a pretty clear story. In the two studies of CNS lymphoma patients receiving transplants, none had a recurrence after two years. Several doctors told me that if you survived two years without relapse, there was a 75-to-90 percent chance the cancer was gone. The one study of consolidation without transplant also showed pretty good results, but less-dramatic. The risk of death from the treatment was 1 percent at my hospital. A small risk of death against a fairly good probability of cure.\n\nAfter going through all the evidence I could find, what initially seemed like a wrenchingly difficult decision became not so hard. It is not pleasant to voluntarily expose yourself to a risk of death, but it was the reasonable thing to do. I was calm, especially because I now thought there was a decent chance I would be cured. The meeting with my doctor to ask final questions ended up being anti-climactic; I had pretty much already decided.\n\nIn late June, after a day of stem-cell harvesting, I entered the hospital for nine days of chemo and another nine of inpatient recovery. For several days, I was delirious with high fever (though no infections); I have no memory of those days, though apparently at one point I started speaking Chinese\u2014I had been listening to Chinese language tapes during my chemo. I was not placed in a bubble, and could have some visitors, but everything I did was characterized by a high level of precaution and very detailed procedures the hospital had developed over the years (the virtue of bureaucracy, I told myself). Computers, books, pens, and other materials coming from the outside world had to be wiped down with disinfectant before entering my room. Visitors needed to wear masks, and I needed to wear one whenever I left the room for a walk. I had no solid food for three weeks, and left the hospital having lost 23 pounds. When I left, I could walk about 10 feet with a cane.\n\nThe procedures and restrictions to reduce infection risk when I arrived home were harsh. My bathroom needed to be disinfected daily. I washed my hands several times a day, rubbing them together long enough to sing the alphabet. All food needed to be cooked so thoroughly the toughness was overwhelming; even dried spices (because of fungus risk) needed to be cooked for ten minutes. Most of the burden of observing these procedures fell on my wife.\n\nThe good news is that my recovery from the transplant has gone better than expected. Most importantly, I did not catch a single infection. Six weeks out, I was walking a mile, now two miles a day. (I first needed a fellow-walker to hold a beach chair so I could rest along the way; my daughter organized a posse of neighbors.) In mid-October, three months after leaving the hospital, I was released from almost all food restrictions and authorized to go into public places, including my office, restaurants, and the subway. I plan to return to teaching in January. As of this writing, my taste buds have recovered from the chemo\u2014for months, lemonade had tasted like tomato juice. But I still have a bad taste in my mouth, and I am still more tired than normal. But I have gained back 70 percent of weight lost in the hospital.\n\nI do not know yet whether I am cured. I have had two MRIs. I will have them every two months for the first year. Meanwhile, there were life changes I promised myself based on insights from being sick, which, with recovery from the transplant, I needed to start thinking about. I had done some volunteering before my illness, but not enough. When I got sick, volunteers from my synagogue often drove me to the hospital; I told myself that if I got better, I would volunteer for the synagogue\u2019s cancer driving activity; three weeks ago, I called to sign up. I also will be speaking with a church in Cambridge about helping an immigrant child who doesn\u2019t speak English at home. And I am going to try to spend more time with friends.\n\nThe healthcare system functioned well for me. I remain amazed at how quickly doctors saw me. Sure, I am a Harvard professor, but my health plan is a widely available one by no means limited to professors. My chemo started immediately. Some hospital routines didn\u2019t function well\u2014the procedures that weren\u2019t there for getting my treatments started, procedures to get me a home health-care worker when I left the hospital after the transplant. But all in all, as a student of organizations, I appreciated how much the standard operating procedures had made me safer. And my doctors, if not always spontaneously communicative (were they trying to spare me worry?) were competent and dedicated.\n\nSomething strange and unexpected started happening to me in November, around when my doctors told me I\u2019d recovered really well from the transplant and could start sometimes going into the office. For the first time since being diagnosed, I was assaulted with anxiety and unease\u2014about dying, about the changes coming to my life as I slowed down a bit at work and prepared to spend time in a new city. Two smart friends to whom I mentioned this provided an insight about what was happening to me. One said, \u201cThat\u2019s why they call it post-traumatic stress disorder. You don\u2019t feel the stress on the battlefield. You feel it after.\u201d Another noted that the University of Pennsylvania psychologist Martin Seligman had researched people\u2019s reactions to natural disasters such as hurricanes, and found they reacted well during the disaster itself, with psychological problems coming afterwards.\n\nWhen I got sick, I decided I didn\u2019t want to retire, but also didn\u2019t want to work at the same obsessive pace as before. In June we bought an apartment in Miami, and I am planning to spend two winter months per year there. This week, the first anniversary of my diagnosis, I went back to teaching\u2014actually teaching some of the exact same classes I couldn\u2019t teach a year ago because of my illness. I have come into to the classroom worried about poorer memory from \u201cchemo brain,\u201d which would be a big problem for me leading class discussions since I must remember what people have said. The in-house teaching consultant who observed my first two classes said I passed with flying colors. But my unease hasn\u2019t gone away. So, while my battle against my disease is over, I hope, now I must return to the challenge of living the rest of my life. I guess those challenges, given my diagnosis, are better than the alternatives.", "wordchoice": ["doctors", "chemo", "cancer", "transplant", "treatment", "cns lymphoma", "hospital", "brain"], "title": "My Experience With Lymphoma"}, {"url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/7wQvQdyoIxs/story01.htm", "corpus": "Washington, D.C., was hit by a severe winter storm this weekend.

And this week, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.\u2019s delegate to Congress, has been rushing to take credit. \u201cI\u2019ve changed the letter of the law,\u201d Norton told local radio station WMAL on Wednesday, adding: \u201cThis was the quickest way to ensure there would be sledding if there was snow this season.\u201d\n\nIn case the message hadn\u2019t been delivered loud and clear, Norton\u2019s office released a statement on Thursday declaring that raucous sledding joy could now take place on Capitol Hill thanks to her. It read: \u201cThe office of Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton ... expects that District of Columbia families will take advantage of potentially record-setting snowfall tomorrow and Saturday by grabbing their sleds and heading to Capitol Hill, which is now open for sledding thanks to language Norton got in the fiscal year 2016 omnibus bill.\u201d (Norton also praised \u201cher good friend\u201d Democratic Congressman Sam Farr for helping to make the change.)\n\nOf course, members of Congress are always looking for creative ways to deliver for their districts, and then, hopefully, reap the rewards after. It\u2019s a time-honored tradition. But for Norton, the Capitol Hill sledding coup\u2014and her ability to talk up her role in making it happen\u2014must feel especially rewarding. Delegates from D.C. don\u2019t vote on the final passage of legislation; Norton is barred from performing the most essential duty of a member of Congress.\n\nTo some extent, that constraint has defined Norton\u2019s time in Congress. In 2012, the Washington Post called it \u201ca fact that makes her the object of sympathy, admiration and no small amount of ridicule.\u201d It\u2019s also a sore subject in Washington, where license plates protest \u201cTaxation without Representation.\u201d\n\nDespite that limitation, Norton has developed something of a reputation for a willingness to be outspoken. And when it comes to the subject of lifting the sledding ban, she has certainly raised her voice. Last February, Norton urged Capitol police to overturn the ban. \u201cAmericans should be able to sled on America\u2019s front lawn,\u201d she wrote to the Capitol Police Board chair. In March, sledders showed up to Capitol Hill in defiance of the ban, initiating a \u201cSled Free or Die\u201d protest. Police were on hand for the act of civil disobedience, but did not seem overly concerned. Norton was ecstatic: \u201cNo enforcement of #sledding ban on Capitol Hill today. Thank you Capitol Police!,\u201d she wrote on Twitter at the time.\n\nNow, Norton is celebrating again. \u201cAttention DC kids and families: Capitol Hill sledding ban has been lifted. Go for it!,\u201d Norton tweeted on Wednesday. Capitol Police warned Thursday that if conditions are unsafe they might have to \u201climit the amount of sledding.\u201d But barring that, police will be out and about on Capitol grounds \u201cto ensure a positive and safe experience for the young sledders.\u201d\n\nOther members of Congress are excited about the snowfall, too. On Friday, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan set up a live feed from his office to track the storm. But don\u2019t expect to see hoards of lawmakers on Capitol Hill this weekend. When WMAL asked Norton if she plans to go sledding herself, she demurred: \u201cI\u2019m not among the kids.

But what does that mean for your respective campaigns? It\u2019s definitely a good thing. Well, it\u2019ll help \u2026 a little \u2026 probably.\n\nLet\u2019s look at how past candidates were doing in the polls before getting the Iowa paper\u2019s endorsement and how they did once all the votes were counted. (I\u2019ve updated my colleague Nate Silver\u2019s table from late 2011.) Here\u2019s how the nine Des Moines Register-approved candidates since 1988 fared in the caucuses versus their prior projected vote totals according to the polls:\n\nSeven of the nine candidates did, in fact, do better than we expected them to do before getting the paper\u2019s endorsement. This includes the most recent four candidates to receive the paper\u2019s seal of approval.\n\nThe paper\u2019s endorsement is credited for greatly improving the fortunes of 2004 Iowa runner-up John Edwards, but most of these candidates haven\u2019t gotten anything like the Edwards bounce. The average post-endorsement bump has been a statistically insignificant 3 percentage points. That\u2019s less than the 8-percentage-point bounce candidates have earned in New Hampshire after locking up an endorsement from the New Hampshire Union Leader. We can also see that both Bob Dole in 1996 and George W. Bush in 2000 lost more than 5 percentage points after getting endorsed by the Des Moines Register.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the paper\u2019s endorsement is meaningless. For one, it may hold more sway for Democrats than for Republicans. All four of the Democrats who have gotten the endorsement have done better than projected, compared to three of the five Republicans. And this year it wouldn\u2019t be surprising, for instance, if the Des Moines Register\u2019s decision not to endorse Donald Trump doesn\u2019t affect his fortunes too much given that the paper already called on him to drop out of the race.\n\nThe Des Moines Register is the largest paper in the state. Even if newspaper circulations are down and most people aren\u2019t going to be swayed by an editorial page endorsement, it could help drive news coverage for days. Most important, both the Democratic and Republican races right now are very tight. Even though Rubio probably won\u2019t receive enough of a boost to win the Republican caucuses in Iowa, the endorsement could help him finish higher there, in turn helping him in the fight to win the title of \u201ctop establishment candidate\u201d in the GOP race. Clinton could be put over the top, however, even if she receives only the 1.1 percentage point bounce she got after the paper\u2019s endorsement of her in 2008.", "wordchoice": ["endorsement", "candidates", "paper", "des moines register", "race", "bounce", "republican", "sway"], "title": "The Des Moines Register\u2019s Endorsements Of Hillary Clinton And Marco Rubio Aren\u2019t Game Changers"}, {"url": "http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-ominous-snow-forecasts-for-new-york-city-were-right/", "corpus": "One of hardest tasks in weather forecasting is projecting snow totals. We saw its perils in January 2015, when meteorologists wiped egg off their faces because New York City didn\u2019t get anywhere near the foot and half or more that was forecasted.\n\nThis weekend, the exact opposite is happening: New York City is getting far more snow than the forecast of 7 to 12 inches from the National Weather Service, which was issued less than 24 hours before the storm hit the city. It\u2019s the perfect example of why forecasts that vary based on probability are so important, and why outlier predictions should not be dismissed.\n\nThe National Weather Service in New York City did a good job expressing the doubt in its forecast through the use of minimum and maximum amounts. You can see that in its Friday morning briefing: Even though the agency was forecasting 7 to 12 inches at the time, its maps listed a minimum potential of less than an inch and a maximum potential of 23 inches in New York City. In this case, the maximum potential looks like it will be closest to the truth.\n\nYou might be saying to yourself, that\u2019s a wide range. But the breadth was well warranted. As I wrote on Wednesday, New York was right on the edge of heavy snowfall. A 50-mile shift in the wrong direction (wrong for this snow-lover, anyway) would have left the city with very little snow, while the same shift in the other direction would have given it what we\u2019re seeing now.\n\nThere were other forecast models suggesting that New York City would get heavy snow. In particular, the North American Mesoscale model showed New York getting hit hard run after run. The run late on Thursday evening, which now looks prescient, showed two feet of snow falling in New York City.\n\nNow, the NAM has been known to forecast too much precipitation (see the aforementioned faux blizzard in New York last year), and it definitely overdid snow amounts north of New York City in this case. Still, as I said on Twitter, you simply couldn\u2019t feel too confident of lower snowfall totals in New York City because the NAM was consistent in calling for big snows. It turns out my warning was justified.\n\nOf course, it could have gone the other way. The Global Forecast System was on the other end of the spectrum and had only about 3 to 4 inches falling in New York City in its run late Thursday night. It forecasted amounts of less than an inch only a few miles away.\n\nWeather buffs might remember that the GFS was one of the models that correctly predicted that last year\u2019s January snow would underperform in New York City. It could have easily been right this time, and many New Yorkers probably would have laughed that forecasters had hyped up another storm.\n\nInstead, it turns out that the GFS was very wrong this time. New York is experiencing a blizzard that blows away most expectations. Fortunately, people who were paying close attention to all the possibilities weren\u2019t caught off guard.", "wordchoice": ["snow", "new york city", "forecast", "inches", "models", "wrong", "nam", "gfs"], "title": "The Most Ominous Snow Forecasts For New York City Were Right"}, {"url": "http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/cavs-fire-coach-david-blatt/", "corpus": "The Cleveland Cavaliers fired head coach David Blatt on Friday, even though he guided the team to the NBA Finals last season and a 30-11 record so far this year.\n\nThe NBA is a tough league. But as far as we can tell, no coach has been fired under similar circumstances before.\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find a table of NBA coaches since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976-77 who were fired or resigned in the middle of the regular season when their teams had an Elo rating of 1550 or higher. The league-average Elo rating is about 1500, so a rating of 1550 reflects a pretty good team; about as good as the Atlanta Hawks right now.\n\nCoaches don\u2019t usually get fired when their teams are playing well. But Blatt\u2019s Cavs haven\u2019t just been good; they\u2019ve been on the verge of great. The team\u2019s current Elo rating is 1669, far higher than that of any other team when it fired a coach mid-season.\n\nWhen a coach does get fired despite a solid record, it\u2019s usually because his team is underperforming lofty expectations. But that can\u2019t really be said of the Cavs. Their preseason team win total at the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook was 56.5 wins; they\u2019re actually a little ahead of that pace, currently projecting to finish the season 61-21 instead.\n\nYes, the Cavs were embarrassed on Monday by the Warriors, 132-98. But one bad regular-season loss isn\u2019t usually enough to doom a coach. It\u2019s reasonable to ask whether the overt tension between Blatt and superstar LeBron James played a role because there\u2019s not really a good precedent for something like this happening. (James was reportedly not consulted about Blatt\u2019s firing.)\n\nLarry Brown resigned under pressure as head coach of the New Jersey Nets late in the 1982-83 season despite a 47-26 record, but that was because he\u2019d agreed to take a job the next season at the University of Kansas. Del Harris was canned as Lakers\u2019 head coach early in the 1998-99 season when the team had a strong 1611 Elo rating, but its record was just 6-6 at that point, below the perennially high expectations in Lakerland.", "wordchoice": ["coach", "team", "blatt", "fired", "nba", "cavs", "season", "elo rating"], "title": "LeBron\u2019s Cavs Are The Best Team Ever To Fire Its Coach Midseason"}, {"url": "http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fivethirtyeights-guide-to-predicting-the-oscars/", "corpus": "We\u2019re a week past the Academy Award nominations, and the FiveThirtyEight election-style Oscar model is up and running.\n\nThe model relies on the idea that the best looks into the minds of Oscar voters are the guild and press prizes that precede the Academy Awards. We have the whole in-depth methodology below, but here\u2019s the gist: Oscar nominees get points for being nominated for or winning other awards that historically predict the Oscars. The better a historical predictor a given award is, the more points it\u2019s worth.\n\nBecause it\u2019s still very early in Oscar season and the only hard win data we have is from the press awards, the initial predictions below should be taken as something between a note on the current state of the race and a way to inform which upcoming award shows you watch live and which ones you just DVR. So based on what we know so far, here\u2019s the state of the race for the top six Oscar categories!\n\nThis race is the most wide open. There are many preceding awards left to go, and the field is large (eight films), which makes it hard to pick a leader. This weekend\u2019s Producers Guild of America awards ceremony should give us a little clarity; the guild\u2019s award for best theatrical picture is the second-most-predictive award we follow for the best picture Oscar.\n\nAt the moment, \u201cSpotlight\u201d leads the race with 14 percent of all possible points locked up. It is followed closely by \u201cThe Revenant\u201d (11 percent of possible points) and \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d (10 points).\n\n\u201cThe Revenant\u201d won the Golden Globe for best drama, but it\u2019s important to keep in mind that despite the popularity of the Globes, the winner of that award matches up with the Academy\u2019s choice only about half the time. \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d has benefited from lots of nominations, as well as wins from the Chicago Film Critics Association and the National Board of Review. Whether that success will carry through to the Producers Guild awards remains to be seen.\n\nAll the awards that have been announced so far have been voted on by members of the press, and while that group does have an inside track on perceiving winners and a means of controlling the narrative, it does not vote on the Academy Awards. It\u2019s worth noting, for instance, that \u201cBoyhood\u201d did very well among the press last year but \u201cBirdman\u201d won the best picture Oscar after thriving at the industry awards.\n\n\u201cSpotlight\u201d is ahead this year because it received the most nominations in the categories we track and thanks to its best picture win at the Critics\u2019 Choice Movie Awards, which are by far the most predictive of any of the press awards.\n\nWhat to watch: This is where we\u2019d greatly benefit from more data. Whichever film wins at the Producers Guild awards will pick up a quarter of the remaining points and will be guaranteed front-runner status until at least February. After that, the key event to watch will be the Directors Guild of America\u2019s top award. Any film that sweeps those two will be a strong favorite for best picture through the rest of February. If two films split them, we\u2019ll have a serious race on our hands.\n\nThanks to a win at the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards, George Miller is leading the race for best director, but it\u2019s still too early to draw conclusions. He\u2019s closely followed by Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, who has pulled the most nominations.\n\nWhat to watch: It\u2019s worth waiting two weeks for the Directors Guild to weigh in before declaring a front-runner because whoever wins that group\u2019s top award has won the Oscar 84 percent of the time over the past 25 years.\n\nLast year, this category was by far the hardest to predict: I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (\u201cBirdman\u201d) won at the Directors Guild, but Richard Linklater (\u201cBoyhood\u201d) won everything else. In the end, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu took home the Oscar. When in doubt, roll with the Directors Guild. If it picks Miller, he will ride into Valhalla shiny and chrome. If it picks I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Tom McCarthy or Adam McKay, that director will become the leader, and we\u2019ll turn to the BAFTAs \u2014 the awards from the British Academy \u2014 to see whether we have a race.\n\nBrie Larson is way out ahead on this one. She won at the Globes, Critics\u2019 Choice, Chicago Film Critics and the National Board of Review awards. Saoirse Ronan and Cate Blanchett command most of the remaining points, mainly because of their many nominations.\n\nBased on our model, this is a three-woman race, mainly because Charlotte Rampling and Jennifer Lawrence aren\u2019t nominated for a Screen Actors Guild or BAFTA award and thus can\u2019t score those points on the board.\n\nWhat to watch: The SAG award will give us the best look at the winner moving forward, but it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that best actress is one of the harder categories to predict. All the prior awards are historically somewhat good at picking the Oscar winner, but no award is all that great at it. The SAG gets it right most often, but don\u2019t sleep on the BAFTAs or even the Satellite Awards, handed out by the International Press Academy. If either of those goes to a woman not nominated for the Oscar, it will shake up the race and make this tough category even more difficult to gauge.\n\nApparently some guy named Leonardo DiCaprio was nominated for an Oscar. Never heard of him.\n\nWhat to watch: The SAG award for best actor is insanely predictive (In the past 25 years, only the Directors Guild has a better track record, for predicting the best director Oscar). Matt Damon isn\u2019t nominated for a SAG award, but if any of the other three Oscar nominees wins the SAG, the Oscar race will get competitive quickly. If Leo wins the SAG award, this category goes from a race to a coronation.\n\nTotal toss-up! Alicia Vikander and Kate Winslet are neck and neck. The Critics\u2019 Choice Award and the Golden Globe for best supporting actress have the same historical predictive rate in this category, and Vikander won the former while Winslet won the latter.\n\nWhat to watch: Both the BAFTA and the SAG awards for best supporting actress are predictive of this category, the latter more so. Winslet, Vikander and Rooney Mara are up for both. Whoever wins the SAG award will be the instant front-runner, but if the BAFTA goes to someone else, this category gets dicey fast.\n\nThis category is interesting because no award is a kingmaker. The most historically predictive show is the Golden Globes \u2014 where Sylvester Stallone won this year; he also took home the Critics\u2019 Choice award \u2014 but that award is voted on by the press and so not weighted as highly in our model.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting, though. Stallone isn\u2019t nominated in the best supporting actor categories at either the SAG or the BAFTAs. Mark Rylance and Christian Bale are nominated for both, and Mark Ruffalo (\u201cSpotlight\u201d) is up for the BAFTA.\n\nIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Rocky loses at the end of \u201cRocky\u201d and probably considered it just an honor to be nominated for the big boxing match to begin with.\n\nWhat to watch: Whether the industry insiders agree with the press that Stallone should win over well-regarded working actor Rylance should be clear once the SAG awards and BAFTAs come through. Still, this will likely be a very close category!\n\nHere\u2019s the gist: We can\u2019t poll the 7,000-odd people who vote on the Academy Awards. We don\u2019t even have a good idea of who exactly they are. This means that unlike the methods we use to predict, say, the Iowa caucuses, the problem we\u2019re trying to solve is pretty much stripped of input data.\n\nBut we do \u2014 or at least will, soon enough \u2014 have some insight into how the Academy will vote, based on a whole batch of other awards given out in the weeks leading up to the big show. Some of those are voted on by some of the same people \u2014 the actors, directors and producers \u2014 who make up the Academy membership. It\u2019s an incomplete picture, but so are polls. So we handle the outcome of those events the same way that the FiveThirtyEight election models handle polls: We figure out how meaningful each is based on a historical predictive track record to determine how much we should weight each one and how much credibility to assign it.\n\nWe pull from press awards and insider awards. We determine the 25-year rolling success rate of each of the prizes in predicting the eventual Academy Award winner and square that success rate to determine a score for each award. Films or people who are nominated for a given award get one-fifth of the resulting points, and winners get the full weight. It\u2019s a simple metric, but it\u2019s worked in the past to get a look into the state of the race.\n\nRight now, we know the nominees for all the awards and the winners for six of the seven press awards. The nominations are helpful, but they don\u2019t give us anywhere near a complete picture. As we get closer to the Oscars \u2014 after the Producers Guild awards this weekend, the American Cinema Editors and Screen Actors Guild awards next week, and so on \u2014 that picture will get much, much clearer.\n\nIn large part because our model gives partial credit for nominations, a majority of the awards points have already been distributed: Only about 39 percent of the maximum possible points remain to be distributed in the best picture category, while in the other five top categories, about a third of the points have yet to be claimed. But those points \u2014 particularly for highly predictive awards like the Directors Guild and SAG prizes \u2014 will swing the races.\n\nOur model is pretty good, but there might be better ones out there. We\u2019re conducting a Predict the Oscars search and will be coming out with more and more reader-submitted Oscar prediction models next week. Be sure to check out our first modelers: two people trying to predict the Oscars using the Internet.", "wordchoice": ["awards", "oscar", "guild", "race", "category", "nominated", "bafta", "predictive"], "title": "\u2019s Guide To Predicting The Oscars"}, {"url": "http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-arent-republican-leaders-rallying-behind-marco-rubio/", "corpus": "Why hasn\u2019t Marco Rubio, widely described as the electable conservative, caught on? It\u2019s difficult to say, and there\u2019s still plenty of time \u2014 before and after Iowa \u2014 for a Rubio surge. Nonetheless, Rubio\u2019s clearest problem is that he hasn\u2019t won over the establishment: He could be the best of both worlds, an establishment-friendly nominee with tea party bona fides, but right now neither camp is rallying behind him with any conviction.\n\nJust look at the endorsements. For several weeks in late 2015, it looked like elected Republicans were inching toward Rubio. But that has largely stopped; Rubio received 10 endorsements from governors and members of Congress in November and seven in December. He has just two so far this month (Ted Cruz has received five), and Jeb Bush still remains the marginal leader in our endorsement tracker. Why aren\u2019t members of Congress coming to save Rubio? Part of the answer may simply be that Rubio is too conservative and too anti-establishment.\n\nRubio\u2019s ideology tends to get lost next to that of Cruz, but he is one of the most conservative members of Congress. We can see this using DW-Nominate, an algorithm that rates members of Congress on a liberal-conservative scale based on their voting record. Rubio is more conservative than 77 percent of Republicans serving in Congress this term.\n\nRubio has only received 10 endorsements from members of Congress who are more liberal than the median Republican. Despite being outflanked on the right by Cruz, he has 17 endorsements from House members and senators more conservative than the median Republican in Congress.\n\nCruz has the most conservative voting record of any member of Congress, according to DW-Nominate, and all but one of his 17 endorsements have come from members more conservative than the median Republican member of Congress.\n\nMore moderate members have been more likely to choose Bush. He has secured a similar number of congressional endorsements to Rubio\u2019s (31 to 27), yet 26 of Bush\u2019s endorsers are more moderate than the median Republican member of Congress. Just five of his endorsers are more conservative than the average member, and just one is more conservative than Rubio.\n\nRubio\u2019s other problem is that his voting pattern seems to be more anti-establishment than the average member of Congress. While it\u2019s not always clear what \u201canti-establishment\u201d means, DW-Nominate\u2019s second dimension, as I have written about, is a decent proxy for it. It isn\u2019t a perfect measurement and it probably overstates Rubio\u2019s disagreements with the GOP leadership. Still, Rubio\u2019s score on this metric indicates he is more anti-establishment than 88 percent of Republicans in Congress. It\u2019d have to be way off for Rubio to somehow be considered establishment friendly.\n\nRubio was elected in 2010 as a tea party supporter who challenged Florida\u2019s sitting governor in a Senate race. Except for immigration reform (on which Rubio\u2019s position seems malleable), there were few occasions when Rubio went to bat for a major cause of the establishment.\n\nIndeed, Rubio\u2019s voting profile more closely resembles the House Freedom Caucus than it does a mainstream Republican. Check out this chart, which combines both dimensions of DW-Nominate and highlights Rubio and the members of the Freedom Caucus.\n\nIf you look solely at this chart, you\u2019d find it hard to imagine that Rubio could somehow be the \u201cestablishment\u201d candidate. Why then was he supposed to be the mainstream savior? Part of that may have to do with his history as a dealmaker in the Florida legislature. A large part is probably because of his competition.\n\nCruz and Donald Trump are about as anti-establishment as you can get. Cruz is hated by many in his party, which might be why Sen. Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, may have said, if jokingly, that he\u2019d rather vote for Bernie Sanders than Cruz. Trump, of course, is Trump.\n\nIn fact, Rubio\u2019s median endorser in Congress is about as establishment-friendly as the median member of Congress, per DW-Nominate. Cruz\u2019s median endorser, on the other hand, sports a score that is more anti-establishment than 72 percent of all members of Congress. Trump hasn\u2019t gotten an endorsement from any member.\n\nRubio\u2019s problem is that the mere threat of Cruz and Trump hasn\u2019t made many mainstream Republicans run to him with open arms. It may be, among other reasons, because they\u2019re afraid that endorsements from the \u201cestablishment\u201d would actually hurt Rubio. Voters seem to want an outsider this year, and YouGov has found that they\u2019ve already pegged Rubio as a member of the establishment.\n\nBut if Rubio\u2019s voting record is any indication, it may be that Republican members of Congress are not choosing Rubio because his record doesn\u2019t line up with theirs. Some may be hoping that Bush, Chris Christie or John Kasich can rally. If they can\u2019t, or if Rubio wins a primary or two, we\u2019ll see if Rubio\u2019s fortunes on the endorsement front change.", "wordchoice": ["rubio", "endorsements", "cruz", "congress", "republican", "members", "anti-establishment", "dw-nominate"], "title": "Why Aren\u2019t Republican Leaders Rallying Behind Marco Rubio?"}, {"url": "http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/record-snow-dc-blizzard/", "corpus": "The Great Blizzard of 2016 (or whatever name you want to give it) is now underway, whitening parts of the Southeast and beginning to crawl up the Eastern Seaboard. This one will challenge records and cause major travel problems from New York through the Carolinas and beyond. Here are a few things to watch for.\n\nWashington\u2019s top five snowstorms are in the chart below. Depending on which model or forecast you believe, the city could see 18 to 30 inches. That gives the storm a legitimate chance of rivaling or exceeding the great Knickerbocker Snowstorm of 1922, which delivered 28 inches to Washington.\n\nWashington\u2019s final snow tally will depend on measurements taken at Reagan National Airport across the Potomac in Virginia. That\u2019s not always ideal to represent Washington\u2019s snowfall, because it\u2019s lower and often a bit warmer than the District.\n\nMuch of the focus has been on Washington. But for Philadelphia, this will be close to a top-five snowstorm too. Recent model data suggests that although it\u2019s unlikely to break the record of 30.7 inches set during the blizzard of 1996, there\u2019s a chance it will make a run for the top two or three.\n\nNew York City, meanwhile, has been a weather forecaster\u2019s worst nightmare. Remember last winter\u2019s forecasting debacle, when the edge of heavy snow largely missed the city? Well, this storm has had similar characteristics (albeit is geographically different) since it became apparent that it was heading east. It now appears that the \u201cedge\u201d has shifted a little farther north, placing most of the New York metro area within the band of heavier snow.\n\nCurrent forecasts call for 8 to 12 inches. [Update: As of 4:30 p.m. Friday, the National Weather Service said the city\u2019s total would probably be from 12 to 18 inches.] There will likely be a range across the metro area, with northern sections (Westchester, Connecticut, parts of northern New Jersey) seeing less and southern areas (Central New Jersey, Staten Island) seeing more. For the official measuring station in Central Park, this probably won\u2019t be a top-end snowstorm.\n\nCounter to last winter, New England will be largely spared the impacts of this storm. The region has earned it, I guess. Drier air and a different storm track (probably fueled in part by our good friend El Ni\u00f1o, adding some oomph to the southern branch of the jet stream) will conspire to mostly shut Boston out of this one and bring more of a \u201cconversational\u201d type snow to New England (though areas close to the coast could deal with strong winds).\n\nThe National Weather Service snow forecast as of 11 a.m. EST Friday.\n\nWill coastal flooding rival that of Hurricane Sandy?\n\nNot exactly. You have to remember, Sandy was a massive hurricane pushing a ton of water toward the East Coast. Although this storm will churn up plenty of water and coastal flooding will be significant (particularly in southern New Jersey and the Delmarva Peninsula), this should not be another Sandy. There\u2019s no real comparison between a massive hurricane making landfall and a departing nor\u2019easter.\n\nNonetheless, this storm has some similarities to storms of the \u201990s that produced significant coastal flooding. Cape May, New Jersey, is projected to see water levels hit about 8.5 feet, which would rank in the top 10 on record there.\n\nOne last point. The term \u201cblizzard\u201d comes with a specific definition, and sometimes those of us in the meteorological community are fiercely defensive of it. Three factors are required for a storm to be classified as a blizzard at a particular place, besides falling or blowing snow:\n\n1. Sustained winds or frequent wind gusts of 35 mph or greater\n\n3. These conditions must persist for three hours.\n\nThis definition is the same whether you\u2019ve got 1 inch or 40 on the ground. This storm will probably meet the criteria in several spots. Regardless, it\u2019s going to snow, and it\u2019s going to be windy, and you\u2019re probably better off enjoying this from your living room if you can.", "wordchoice": ["storm", "snow", "inches", "blizzard", "snowstorm", "30", "sandy", "washington"], "title": "This Blizzard Could Rewrite The Storm Record Books"}, {"url": "http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-math-and-not-a-telescope-may-have-found-a-new-planet/", "corpus": "The scientists who made headlines this week by announcing evidence for a new planet in our solar system are basing the claim entirely on a mathematical model. Nobody\u2019s seen the thing, but the math says it\u2019s there. This isn\u2019t the first time scientists have found a new planet before really finding it, but this technique also has produced outright blunders. This time, though, astronomers say there\u2019s reason to take the new potential planet seriously.\n\nPlanet Nine, as the astronomers have dubbed it, would be the first genuine planet discovered in our solar system since Neptune was found in 1846. (Pluto, found in 1930, was officially removed from the list of planets in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union.) And it\u2019d be a big one. The model predicts that Planet Nine is five to 10 times the mass of Earth. Astronomers say it is possible such a substantial object could have eluded detection, because it allegedly lurks in the farthest outskirts of the solar system \u2014 moving in a lopsided path whose closest approach to the sun is still 40 times as far as Neptune. Each orbit would take upward of 10,000 years.\n\nCaltech astronomers Michael Brown and Konstantin Batygin say they\u2019ve observed six icy bodies in the distant solar system moving in skinny, oblong orbits that are roughly aligned, like pencils pointing in approximately the same direction. Such a configuration is unlikely, they say, without something else forcing them to exist like that. That something else, they think, is Planet Nine.\n\nTheir paper, published in The Astronomical Journal on Wednesday, says the odds are only .007 percent that this pattern would occur \u201cby chance,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a 99.993 percent chance the planet is there. There are still many ways that the scientists could have made an error or overlooked some subtle source of bias, or there could be another explanation for their data. \u201cI\u2019d be willing to bet about 50/50 odds, maybe better, that there\u2019s another planet out there,\u201d said Scott Tremaine, an astronomer at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He said he places the claim \u201csomewhere between prediction and speculation.\u201d\n\nThe case for the new planet builds on a 2014 paper in the journal Nature by Scott Sheppard and Chadwick Trujillo. They observed the properties of about a dozen objects, including a brand-new object the pair found in the outer fringes of the solar system. (Like Pluto, these icy bodies are not big enough to qualify as planets.)\n\nSheppard, of the Carnegie Institution for Science, said it was not a huge sample but it was enough to recognize an improbable pattern in the objects\u2019 orbits. Their paper explored the possibility that a massive unseen planet had \u201cherded\u201d the smaller objects into an otherwise unlikely alignment.\n\nIn the new paper, Brown and Batygin took things a step further, proposing a very elongated orbit for the unseen planet and a more detailed mechanism by which it might have herded the smaller bodies.\n\nBrown is highly respected in astronomy circles. He\u2019s best known for his role in the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet \u2014 a change that was brought on partly by his skill of discovering other small, icy bodies comparable in size to Pluto. Either these had to be classified as planets or Pluto had to go. He popularized the episode in a book called \u201cHow I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming,\u201d and he tweets under the handle @plutokiller.\n\nBatygin said in an interview that their Planet Nine prediction follows the same general concept that led to the discovery of Neptune. In the mid-1800s, astronomers and mathematicians realized that the orbit of Uranus, then the farthest known planet, wasn\u2019t behaving the way Newton\u2019s law of gravity predicted. They calculated that it might be under the influence of a more distant, unseen planet. That turned out to be Neptune, but in that case, \u201cthe signal to noise ratio was much higher\u201d than it is for Planet Nine, Tremaine said.\n\nAstronomer Hal Levison, of the Southwest Research Institute, said the case for Planet Nine is plausible but, invoking the words of Carl Sagan, the researchers haven\u2019t yet presented the kind of extraordinary evidence needed to back such an extraordinary claim. Although mathematical models have helped scientists completely rewrite the formation of the solar system in the past 20 years, history holds some important cautionary tales.\n\nIn the early 20th century, astronomer Percival Lowell calculated a discrepancy in the orbit of Neptune that he attributed to an unseen Planet X. Lowell hired Clyde Tombaugh to look for Planet X, and lo and behold, Tombaugh found Pluto. In 1930, Pluto was thought to be a big planet \u2014 considerably more massive than Earth. It took until the 1970s for people to figure out that Pluto was a lightweight, only a fraction of the mass of the moon and too small to be nudging Neptune\u2019s orbit. By then it also came out that Lowell\u2019s calculations were based on an incorrect mass for Neptune. With that adjustment, there was no need for a Planet X to explain Neptune\u2019s motion. \u201cThis was one of the amazing coincidences in the history of astronomy,\u201d Levison said. This little shiny thing was exactly where Lowell\u2019s erroneous calculations led them.\n\nLevison said that if Planet Nine does exist, there\u2019s no good explanation for how it got to its remote location. It couldn\u2019t have been born there, he said. There isn\u2019t enough material out there to form a planet. It might have been flung outward after formation, but with a hard enough push to get it out that far, it\u2019s hard to understand why it didn\u2019t just keep going right out of the solar system.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of how a planet more than five times the size of the Earth hasn\u2019t been detected yet. Astronomer Renu Malhotra of the University of Arizona said it\u2019s possible Planet Nine is being blocked by glare from stars in the densest part of our galaxy. The planet itself may even have a dark surface, making it unusually hard to spot, she said.\n\nMultiple scientists I spoke with agreed it\u2019s premature to believe in Planet Nine but that the evidence is compelling enough to justify a search for it. \u201cI think there\u2019s still a lot of unexplored space in the outer solar system where planets could be lurking,\u201d Malhotra said. Planet X turned up Pluto.

That\u2019s generally true for candidates as well: They campaign across Iowa, but spend most of their time in the capital. There were candidate events in Des Moines every single day last week, starting with the Brown and Black Presidential Forum at Drake University on Monday night and ending with the live taping of \u201cMorning Joe\u201d with guest Donald Trump at Java Joes Coffeehouse downtown on Friday.\n\nBut not one of our trips to events and field offices in Des Moines took us to the southern and eastern parts of the city. As the week wore on, it became clear that the parts of the city farther east of the Des Moines River and south toward the airport \u2014 where population and median home values drop significantly compared with the western areas of Des Moines \u2014 were far less frequented by candidates.\n\nYou can\u2019t blame candidates for focusing on the most populous areas of Des Moines, but there are neighborhoods in south and east Des Moines with just as many people (or more) as the western areas that no candidate, Democratic or Republican, has visited during this campaign cycle. And those areas are poorer than the candidate-hives in West Des Moines.\n\nAccording to data from The Des Moines Register\u2019s candidate tracker, there have been 416 events (314 for GOP candidates and 102 for the Democrats) in the greater Des Moines urban area since Nov. 17, 2012. For Republican candidates, 85 percent of these events took place in the westernmost areas of Des Moines. For the Democratic candidates, 82 percent were in these same neighborhoods. Only 36 events have occurred south of Raccoon River, and even fewer \u2014 22 events \u2014 have taken place east of downtown Des Moines.\n\nOnce we realized the candidates weren\u2019t visiting areas east or south of Des Moines, we decided to go. Driving around eastern Des Moines, we could immediately see why not many candidates ventured east across the railroad tracks, where there are far fewer businesses and homes. The population density in the easternmost city that had an event, Pleasant Hill (a meet-and-greet for Carly Fiorina at a former mayor\u2019s house in October 2015) is just under 1,000 people per square mile, compared with the most dense areas of Des Moines, where the population is almost seven times greater.\n\nBut population doesn\u2019t entirely explain why no candidate had stopped near Grand View University or in the Capitol Heights neighborhood, two areas near Pleasant Hill where the population density is closer to 6,000 people per square mile. The same is true in areas of southern Des Moines, around South Park and Jordan Park, where the population density is almost five times greater than the farthest west areas in West Des Moines.\n\nSo we decided to also look at the median home values in the areas candidates aren\u2019t going.\n\nCandidates are less likely to visit poorer neighborhoods outside of downtown Des Moines.\n\nMedian home values in some of the most affluent areas in Des Moines are more than $200,000, but that drops to $117,600 in Des Moines city proper. In the poorest census tract shown (in southern Des Moines near the airport) there has been just one candidate event, a Bobby Jindal town hall meeting at the Fort Des Moines Museum, where the median home value is $32,500. There haven\u2019t been any events in the next-poorest census tract, the one directly east of downtown, where median home values are $66,900.\n\nAt Skip\u2019s, a restaurant in the more affluent area of southern Des Moines, Molly Freel, the lunch-shift bartender, told us that Bernie Sanders was just there a few days earlier eating lunch, but she didn\u2019t have any good reasons why the candidates didn\u2019t come south more often to host events. \u201cWe\u2019re so close to the airport, this would be a perfect place to stop,\u201d she said. \u201cThe candidates just don\u2019t come to the south side.\u201d", "wordchoice": ["des moines", "candidates", "events", "areas", "population", "neighborhoods", "median home", "south"], "title": "Candidates Aren\u2019t Visiting Poorer Parts Of Des Moines"}, {"url": "http://feeds.dailykos.com/~r/dailykos/index/~3/SZehZWRVPcQ/-Donald-Trump-knows-his-base-Says-I-could-stand-in-the-middle-of-5th-Avenue-and-shoot-people", "corpus": "Lauding his fans' loyalty at a campaign event in Sioux Center, Iowa, on Saturday, Trump said he could kill people and still be popular.\n\n\u201cI have the most loyal people, did you ever see that?

He was sixty miles away headed home when the\u00a0stove he had stolen fell off the back of the truck onto the highway. A few minutes later, David\u00a0Piquette, a sheriff's deputy in Los Angeles, swerved to avoid hitting the stove and collided with a tractor trailer carrying cement. He was killed. Two years later, Wilkins was convicted of first\u00a0degree murder.\n\nDoes first degree murder sound like an outrageous charge here? Well, this is an\u00a0extreme example of the problems with the felony murder rule, which\u00a0says that a defendant can be found guilty of first\u00a0degree murder if a person dies in the course of that defendant committing a felony. Wilkins had recently committed burglary and therefore, the state argued, was guilty of murdering Piquette.\n\nWilkins appealed the ruling, but the appellate court ruled for the state, too. He appealed again, and this time the California Supreme Court reversed.\n\nThe court found that the jury had not been given adequate instructions before convicting Wilkins, because they\u00a0weren't instructed that the crime of burglary only continues until the burglar has successfully escaped from the scene.

It was inherently a political entity, giving money to candidates to advance the cause of gay rights. Its leaders worked hard to promote it as a powerful symbol of the gay community within the Beltway that would ideally become a part of Washington's political establishment. In all likelihood, the organization's leadership was tickled pink to be officially labeled as such by Sanders\u00a0only to the have one of the most enduring figures in modern-day politics\u2014the Clintons\u2014come to its defense.\n\nAs the nation's largest LGBT organization, HRC has become representative enough of the movement for many mainstream Americans to be familiar with it, its iconic equality logo, and the struggle it generally represents. Still, the organization does not hold the same resonance with as broad an audience as Planned Parenthood does through the communities of women it has provided\u00a0critical health\u00a0services to nationwide\u00a0for 100 years now.\n\nThe possible nationwide LGBTQ constituency stirred\u00a0one way or the other by Sanders' comments is probably in the single digits to the best of our knowledge, since the number of voters who self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender\u00a0typically sits at around 3.5 to\u00a05 percent in polls.\n\nBut the potential female constituency with an interest in Planned Parenthood rests at nearly 51 percent of the nation. No, not all women are fans of Planned Parenthood, just like not all LGBTQ Americans are fans of HRC. But the organization's sustained hands-on work with women across the country even as it comes under constant attack, both political and literal, has earned it a certain sainthood status among a great many women\u2014across\u00a0all races and varying socio-economic strata. It is the very reason that Planned Parenthood recently polled higher than any other political entity or leader in the nation, registering an overall favorable rating of 45 percent with Americans (Trump, 26 percent; GOP, 28 percent; Democrats, 38 percent; Supreme Court, 39 percent; National Rifle Association, 43 percent).\n\nIn some ways, inside the Beltway, Planned Parenthood's leadership could be viewed as a part of the political establishment. Cecile Richards is the daughter of the inimitable Ann Richards, the late pithy and beloved former Democratic governor of Texas. As a keynote speaker at the 1988 Democratic Convention, the elder Richards famously quipped that George H.W. Bush couldn't help himself for never taking an interest in child care or education.\u00a0\"Poor George,\u201d she drawled.\u00a0\u201cHe can't help it \u2014 he was born with a silver foot in his mouth.\" It doesn't get much more political than that, which is not a knock on her\u00a0or her daugther. It is simply to say that Cecile Richards has both the grooming and the connections to be viewed by some as part of the political establishment.\n\nThat said, her organization and the constituency it services is anything but establishment and the optics of Bernie Sanders painting it as such were terrible politically. So even if some people inside the Beltway privately agree with Sanders' assessment, outside the Beltway\u2014in places like Iowa, where abortions services are under constant attack by Republicans and the religious right\u2014his assertion was\u00a0deeply offensive.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic race has been closing, especially in Iowa, where Clinton's once double-digit lead\u00a0over Sanders has dwindled considerably, with some polls showing Sanders in the lead.\u00a0The Ann Selzer/Des Moines Register poll attributes the trend\u00a0mainly to a rise in \"undecideds.\"\n\nWhat's hard to know is which demographic\u00a0groups among the undecideds\u00a0are most\u00a0up for grabs.\n\nThe conventional wisdom seems to be that if Sanders loses Iowa, even if he wins New Hampshire, he's going to have a tough time succeeding in the primaries that follow. However, if he wins Iowa outright and also takes New Hampshire, perhaps there's more of a race to be had. As a general\u00a0rule, I don\u2019t place much faith in CW, but that at least makes Iowa super interesting.\n\nSo the question is whether this week\u2019s dustup\u00a0will have any effect heading into the Feb. 1 Iowa caucus. Will Bernie's assertion about Planned Parenthood hurt him with his younger cohort of true believers? Probably not. Nor will he\u00a0take much of\u00a0a hit with his male supporters.\n\nBut he does have the potential to lose his shot at wooing some women away from Clinton. This latest \u201csquirmish\u201d (to quote the ever quotable\u00a0Sarah Palin) happened too recently to know whether it\u2019s had much effect.\u00a0But if there were to be a late-stage development that could stem the clear\u00a0build in\u00a0momentum for Sanders\u00a0in these final\u00a0weeks, it would likely be a spontaneous misstep\u00a0like this.\n\nAlong with her usual arguments about competency and electability, Clinton certainly pressed\u00a0the \"establishment\"\u00a0point this week.\n\nAs for Sanders, after making the\u00a0argument for several days, he finally backtracked\u00a0on Friday, the 43rd anniversary of Roe v. Wade.\n\nAnd he also\u00a0made some promises while campaigning at a New Hampshire\u00a0high school.", "wordchoice": ["sanders", "percent", "political", "beltway", "iowa", "clinton", "women", "race"], "title": "View from the left\u2014the establishment factor"}, {"url": "http://feeds.dailykos.com/~r/dailykos/index/~3/6CPJLdXDIsQ/-I-saw-Selma-for-the-first-time-on-MLK-day", "corpus": "They called him traitor.\u00a0They called him degenerate.\u00a0An agitator.

What would your uncle think about what\u2019s going on in his America today?\u201d Aveda King, who is often featured on Fox News for her conservative views, suggested that some people were \u201cstirring up that fear and that anger.\u201d \u201cPut some solutions on the table, teaching people to use their words, rather than bombs or guns or fists,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd use their words to heal rather than destroy.\u201d\n\nConservatives often argue that Dr. King\u2019s movement \u201csolved\u201d all our race problems.\u00a0But now seven\u00a0years into administration of our first African-American president\u00a0those who may have felt that way have been clearly proven wrong.\n\nBack in 2008, it seemed as though a coalition of people of color, progressive whites and young people had finally triumphed. Even if there was an initial backlash on the part of some skeptical whites, we looked with hope toward scholarship that showed, in time, black executives eventually won over enough of their constituents to effectively govern. By well into Obama\u2019s second term \u2013 in other words, now \u2013 went the thinking back then, the country should find itself beyond race. Obama\u2019s presence in the Oval Office, and his demonstrated competence as the nation\u2019s chief executive, would make whites more comfortable with blacks. As a result, racism would begin to fade away, eventually disappearing. Instead, the racial climate during Obama\u2019s watch has become even more divisive. Seven years into his presidency, we\u2019ve witnessed one race-related tragedy after another. The murder of Trayvon Martin was followed by the Charleston massacre, and the deaths of black folks at the hands of white police officers in Illinois, Ohio, New York, South Carolina and Texas.\n\nIt just so happens that on this very same day, DeRay McKesson, one of the people who has been putting forth his words and his commitment against injustice as a proponent of Black Lives Matter and an author of the Campaign Zero project which has produced a ten-point plan for racial justice was featured on Stephen Colbert\u2019s Late Show.\n\nSo yes, we should remember King.\u00a0Correctly. We should learn from King.\u00a0The issues of his time were not simple, he was not a simple or a perfect man.\u00a0The situation was messy then, it is messy now.\u00a0We should take heed and take note.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the blood, the violence, the doubt and the struggles of which we should note, it\u2019s also the eventual triumph as words King used to criticize Johnson are eventually echoed by him in his sour critique of Wallace.\u00a0Eventually his words broke through, eventually the message was received, and eventually it will be received in our current time.\u00a0With activists like the leaders of BLM, and like McKesson and\u00a0Shaun King, police officers who are willing to come forward and confirm the reality of black America as has Sgt.

Having initially manufactured all their own components, carmakers currently retain primary control of making only vehicles\u2019 powertrains \u2014 their engines and transmissions \u2014 he added. \u201cIf we start losing any of that\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we will not be able to hang on to any proprietary knowledge and control of that business,\u201d said Mr Marchionne. \u201cWe won\u2019t be manufacturing the batteries.

One, as you have probably already guessed, is George Orwell\u2019s Big Brother, from 1984. The other is Michel Foucault\u2019s panopticon \u2014 a vision, adapted from Jeremy Bentham, of a prison in which captives cannot tell if or when they are being watched. Today, both of these touchstones are considered chillingly prophetic. But in Exposed: Desire and Disobedience in the Digital Age, Bernard Harcourt has another suggestion: Both of them are insufficient.\n\n1984, Harcourt acknowledges, was an astoundingly farsighted text, but Orwell failed to anticipate the role pleasure would come to play in our culture of surveillance \u2014\u00a0specifically, the way it could be harnessed, as opposed to suppressed, by powerful interests. Oceania\u2019s \u201cHate Week\u201d is nowhere to be found; instead, we live in a world of likes, favorites, and friending. Foucault\u2019s panopticon, in turn, needs a similar update; mass incarceration aside, the panopticon \u2014 for the rest of us \u2014 has become participatory, more of an amusement park or shopping mall than a penal institution. Rather than being coerced to reveal secrets, today we seem to enjoy self-exposure, giving away \u201cour most intimate information and whereabouts so willingly and passionately \u2014 so voluntarily.\u201d\n\nExposed is a welcome addition to the current spate of books about technology and surveillance. While it covers familiar ground \u2014 it opens with brief accounts of Facebook\u2019s methods of tracking users, USAID\u2019s establishment of ZunZuneo (a Twitter-like social network) in Cuba, and Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations of the NSA\u2019s PRISM program \u2014 Harcourt\u2019s contribution is uniquely indebted to critical theory. Riffing on the work of another French philosopher, Gilles Deleuze, and his evocative 1992 fragment \u201cPostscript on the Societies of Control,\u201d Harcourt settles upon the phrase \u201cExpository Society\u201d to describe our current situation, one in which we \u201chave become dulled to the perils of digital transparence\u201d and enamored of exposure. This new form of expository power, Harcourt explains, \u201cembeds punitive transparence into our hedonist indulgences and inserts the power to punish in our daily pleasures.\u201d\n\nThe expository society has been long in the making. Its roots are in ancient Greece and Rome, where the \u201cage of the spectacle\u201d commenced and began its evolution. It is worth quoting Harcourt\u2019s summary of this history at length:\n\nAnd yet, while spectacles and surveillance may be \u201ccostless\u201d and \u201cpractically free,\u201d the expository society is fundamentally about profit. On the corporate side, the business models of companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter, Uber, and Amazon are based on the principle of user enjoyment. Social media, we all know from experience, is addictive; our pleasure is habit-forming by design.\n\nThis is the first crux of Harcourt\u2019s argument: The expository society exploits, rather than represses, our desires. The second crux is his observation that government and commercial surveillance infrastructures have wholly merged.\n\nOne of the book\u2019s more important chapters takes on the seemingly self-evident nature of the term \u201csurveillance state,\u201d which Harcourt argues is misleading. What we have, instead, is an \u201camalgam of the intelligence community, retailers, Silicon Valley, military interests, social media, the Inner Beltway, multinational corporations, midtown Manhattan, and Wall Street\u201d that \u201cforms an oligarchic concentration that defies any such reductionism.\u201d Citing Glenn Greenwald, he notes that 70 percent of the United States\u2019 national intelligence budget is spent on the private sector. \u201cWhatever it is that is surveilling us, then, is not simply \u2018the state,\u2019\u201d he writes. A more accurate image, he suggests, is a \u201ctenticular oligarchy\u201d \u2014 a \u201clarge oligopolistic octopus\u201d enveloping the world, neither fully public nor fully private but both.\n\nThe expository society is indeed a paradoxical beast. Punishment and pleasure have fused, and commerce and surveillance are now one and the same (the convenience of GrubHub, Lyft, Paypal, Instagram, and AT&T is irresistible despite the troubling data-trails). Still, Exposed occasionally collapses categories and situations that are, despite their similarities, crucially distinct. For example, at multiple points Harcourt compares the Apple Watch to an ankle bracelet used for monitoring parolees: \u201cThe Apple Watch begins to function as the ankle bracelet. All is seen, all can be seen, all can be monitored \u2014 inside or out, where we are, free or supervised, we are permanently surveilled.\u201d It may be true that these tracking devices exist on a data-collection continuum. But the experiences of their respective users could not be more different \u2014 and this matters. A person wearing an Apple Watch may be transmitting information, including heart rate and location, that should give them pause, but they are not subjected to the same punitive gaze as a parolee or a prisoner under correctional supervision \u2014 or, for that matter, a laborer whose every movement on the job is tracked, or a welfare recipient whose purchases are assessed by a prying social worker. \u201cPrivacy,\u201d Harcourt himself writes, \u201chas been privatized.\u201d It is becoming a luxury good, available only to those who can afford it.\n\nHarcourt\u2019s analysis hinges on desire: We want to participate, we are impelled to do so, and we like it. But it seems to me we are as much compelled as we are impelled. In my own work on new media, I have described this as a shift from the old model of \u201cmanufacturing consent,\u201d where traditional broadcasters molded public opinion from on high, to one of \u201cmanufacturing compulsion,\u201d where we are, at least superficially, in charge of our media destinies, clicking on whatever we choose.\n\nIn reality things aren\u2019t so simple: Recommendation algorithms, advertising, and addictive interfaces all chip away at our autonomy in different manners. What\u2019s more, we are forced to participate in online life in myriad ways. Students are advised to manage their social media profiles so they can get into a good college; adults are compelled to groom their LinkedIn profiles in order to secure employment; journalists and other creative professionals are told they must join Twitter to promote their work; and so on. Credit scores are a prime example of this logic of compulsion. We don\u2019t manage our scores for fun but under threat of penalty, in the form of higher interest rates or fees. With a bevy of start-ups innovating new modes of consumer scoring \u2014 many of which use information from data brokers in ways that shrewdly bypass inadequate consumer protections \u2014 we may soon be induced to adapt our online behavior to accommodate them (for example, by not being \u201cfriends\u201d with people the algorithms deem credit risks).\n\nUnderstanding the degree to which we are compelled to participate, as opposed to lamenting the degree to which we desire our own oppression, is important if we want to devise strategies for resistance. Movements derive more energy from tapping into people\u2019s grievances than chastising them for complacency.\n\nThe challenge \u2014 and this brings us to the book\u2019s concluding section \u2014 is how the \u201cdisobedience\u201d of Harcourt\u2019s subtitle can effectively push back against expository power. Exposed closes on a hopeful note, pointing to pockets of resistance and successful rebels, all people worth celebrating: Chelsea Manning and WikiLeaks, artists like Trevor Paglen and Laura Poitras, free software advocates such as Eben Moglen. But Harcourt\u2019s proposed solutions are not entirely satisfying. He considers boycotting Facebook a radical act, and I disagree. If our goal is to build a robust movement capable of taking on the new power structure he describes, we will have to meet people, at least initially, where they are. More than 1\u00a0billion of them are on Facebook. A movement made up only of those savvy enough to congregate on more obscure and secure corners of the internet is destined to remain small. Mass mobilization is an important component of any serious strategy for social change.\n\nOn the final page of the book, Harcourt praises Occupy Wall Street, not for its mission but for its supposedly leaderless form. (Some of us who were involved in Occupy might challenge that characterization.) The better lesson to take from Occupy is not its approach, which was imperfectly implemented and produced mixed results, but its willingness to challenge capitalism and inequality directly. Ultimately, the society of exposure that Harcourt criticizes is a symptom of the oligarchy\u2019s escalating attack on democracy. The best solution may not be to combat surveillance directly, but to attack the disease: the arrangements that have allowed an unaccountable political and economic elite to emerge.\n\nIt is true, as Harcourt writes, that the \u201ccustomary lines between politics, economics, and society are rapidly vanishing and melding into one\u201d; it is true that the state has merged with corporate interests. But it is also true that the state remains one of the public\u2019s most powerful weapons. If compelled by a powerful social movement, the state could aggressively enforce anti-trust regulations, pass a baseline cross-sector privacy law, enforce labor rights for employees of digital disruptors such as Uber, rein in the financial apparatus that has abetted the latest tech bubble with its massively inflated start-up valuations, and invest in public options such as municipal broadband (paid for, perhaps, with the taxes tech companies are currently dodging by sheltering assets overseas). Instead of merely hiding from the oligopolistic octopus, we should strive to free ourselves from its grip.\n\nThis article\u00a0was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project.", "wordchoice": ["harcourt", "surveillance", "expository society", "social", "facebook", "pleasure", "exposed", "compelled"], "title": "Why Do We Expose Ourselves?"}, {"url": "https://theintercept.com/2016/01/23/clinton-goldman-sachs-laugh/", "corpus": "After Hillary Clinton spoke at\u00a0a town hall in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Friday, I asked her if she would release the transcripts of her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs.

And several of those endorsements were accompanied by criticisms from members about the lack of a democratic process.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps the clearest example yet of Clinton\u2019s powerful appeal to the Democratic Party\u2019s elite, even as support for Sanders explodes among the rank and file.\n\nFor example, Clinton got an endorsement from the Human Rights Campaign this week. That decision was made\u00a0not by a vote of HRC\u2019s membership list but instead by a 32-member executive board\u00a0that includes Mike Berman, the president of a lobbying firm that works\u00a0for Pfizer, Comcast, and the health insurance lobby. Northrup Grumman is among its list of major corporate sponsors.\n\nThe Sanders campaign blasted the group as \u201cestablishment\u201d and said that Sanders has a much stronger record on LGBT equality than Clinton.

The UFCW\u2019s board and its president then offered a surprising endorsement to Clinton. UFCW\u2019s chief nemesis is Wal-Mart, a corporation on whose board Clinton sat for six years.\n\nThe one major labor union that did allow for a vote was the Communications Workers of America. CWA followed a three-month process that included meetings with members, telephone town halls, and an online polling voting process.\n\n\u201cWe conducted an online membership poll from mid-September to early December,\u201d said CWA spokesperson Candice Johnson in a statement to The Intercept. \u201cTens of thousands of members voted in the poll, with Sanders getting a decisive majority.\u201d Johnson noted that CWA did not endorse in 2008 because they followed the same process and the three leading Democratic candidates all received around the same proportion of votes.\n\n\u201cCWA had a really good model for how to do this \u2026 certainly better than what [SEIU] did,\u201d said Ed Hunt, who is in SEIU Local 503 in Oregon and objects to his union\u2019s endorsement process, which was based on non-binding membership polling and town halls followed by an executive board vote. \u201cFor me an ideal process would have been a process where we talk about the issues and the candidates\u2019 stance on the issues followed by a vote.\u201d\n\nWhile all four major organizations that held membership votes endorsed Sanders, two that did not hold open membership votes also endorsed him: the American Postal Workers Union (APWU) and National Nurses United.\n\nSanders was endorsed by MoveOn with 78 percent of voters choosing him; in the Democracy for America vote, he won nearly 88 percent; and\u00a087 percent of Working Families Party voters chose Sanders.\n\nMany of the groups that did not hold an outright membership vote were not entirely transparent in disclosing how they endorsed candidates.

While Clinton hasn\u2019t laid out any specifics, almost all House Democrats have co-sponsored the Government by the People Act, which would match political donations up to $150 at a six-to-one ratio with public money.

Dhiab\u2019s lawyers have called the footage \u201cextremely disturbing.\u201d\n\nIn a notice filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., lawyers for the Justice Department said that they would appeal the judge\u2019s order to release the tapes. The government has previously said that the videos are properly classified, and that if released, they might \u201cinflame Muslim sensitivities overseas.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit originated when Dhiab asked a judge to halt what he said was a painful and punitive procedure of force-feeding. Dhiab was released to Uruguay in December 2014, but a group of news\u00a0organizations, including The Intercept\u2019s parent company, First Look Media, intervened in the case to argue that the videos should be made public.\n\nU.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler originally ordered the videos released in October 2014, but the government has pushed back with appeals and delayed with arguments over redactions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that \u2014 yet again \u2014 Obama\u2019s lawyers have suppressed the evidence that shows most eloquently why the president is right, and Guant\u00e1namo ought to close,\u201d Cori Crider, an attorney with the human rights group Reprieve, said in a statement. Crider, who has seen the tapes, said they \u201cwould make your blood run cold.\u201d\n\nIn an editorial published Wednesday, the Miami Herald\u00a0\u2014 whose reporter Carol Rosenberg is the most stalwart observer of operations at the detention center \u2014 said that appealing to prevent the release of the videos would be tantamount to \u201caiding, basically, a government cover-up\u201d of detainee abuse.\n\nThe paper compared the tapes to the infamous photos of prisoners at Abu Ghraib, writing that \u201cdisclosure of such horrors, though difficult to hear and to see, is at the foundation of Americans\u2019 right to know what it being done on their behalf.\u201d\n\nRosenberg has been tracking the number of Guant\u00e1namo detainees on hunger strike since a mass protest began in March 2013. At one point, more than 100 detainees were refusing food, and nearly half of them were being tube-fed. The Pentagon stopped publicly reporting the numbers of detainees refusing food or being force-fed in December 2013, saying that it was simply a way for the detainees to \u201cdraw attention to themselves, and so we\u2019re not going to help them do that.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, the Obama administration has transferred 16 men out of Guant\u00e1namo, part of a final-year push to close the prison. \u00a0Last week, 10 Yemeni prisoners were sent to Oman. Many of Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s so-called forever prisoners \u2014 men the Obama administration could not charge with a crime, but whom it deems too dangerous to release \u2014 have been alerted that they are eligible for hearings with interagency review boards, which will evaluate their status (although how swiftly those reviews will actually proceed is an open question).\n\nThe Pentagon announced\u00a0Thursday that two men had been resettled in Balkan nations. A third man, Mohammed Bwazir of Yemen, refused to go to the unnamed country that had agreed to take him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been in Guant\u00e1namo so long that he was terrified about going to a country other than one where he had family,\u201d\u00a0Bwazir\u2019s lawyer told the Miami Herald.", "wordchoice": ["detainees", "guant namo", "dhiab", "prisoners", "release", "force-fed", "lawyers", "judge"], "title": "U.S. Escalates Battle to Keep Guant\u00e1namo Force-Feeding Tapes Hidden"}, {"url": "https://theintercept.com/2016/01/21/nsa-chief-stakes-out-pro-encryption-position-in-contrast-to-fbi/", "corpus": "National Security Agency Director\u00a0Adm. Mike Rogers said Thursday that \u201cencryption is foundational to the future,\u201d and arguing about it is a waste of time.\n\nSpeaking to the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C., think tank, Rogers stressed that the cybersecurity battles the U.S. is destined to fight call for more widespread use of encryption, not less. \u201cWhat you saw at OPM, you\u2019re going to see a whole lot more of,\u201d he said, referring to the massive hack of the Office of Personnel Management involving the\u00a0personal data about 20 million people who have gotten background checks.\n\n\u201cSo spending time arguing about \u2018hey, encryption is bad and we ought to do away with it\u2019 \u2026 that\u2019s a waste of time to me,\u201d he said, shaking his head.\n\n\u201cSo what we\u2019ve got to ask ourselves is, with that foundation, what\u2019s the best way for us to deal with it? And how do we meet those very legitimate concerns from multiple perspectives?\u201d\n\nOther government officials \u2014\u00a0most notably FBI Director James Comey \u2014 have been crusading for a way that law enforcement can get access to encrypted data.\n\nBut technologists pretty much universally agree that creating some sort of special third-party access would weaken encryption to the point that it would threaten every internet transaction we make, from online banking to filling out our health records to emailing our friends and significant others. A hole in encryption for special FBI access would be a hole that criminals could sneak through, too.\n\nWhile there\u2019s been a lot of talk about\u00a0giving up some privacy for security, Rogers said both are paramount.\n\n\u201cConcerns about privacy have never been higher. Trying to get all those things right, to realize that \u2014 it isn\u2019t about one or the other,\u201d he said. He does not think that \u201csecurity is the imperative and that ought to drive everything.\u201d Nor should privacy, he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to meet these two imperatives. We\u2019ve got some challenging times ahead of us, folks.\u201d\n\nComey, who formerly advocated for a way to get law enforcement access without weakening encryption, recently switched tactics. Now he is pressuring companies to change their business models and simply not offer true end-to-end encryption to their\u00a0customers.\n\nThe White House\u00a0has decided not to pursue legislation to outlaw unbreakable end-to-end encryption, following pressure from privacy advocates and scientists. But the intelligence community\u2019s top lawyer, Bob Litt, privately advised the administration that a major terrorist attack could be an opportune moment to do so.\n\nAnd the White House has not issued a statement in defense of encryption, to the frustration of Apple CEO Tim Cook, among others.\n\nMeanwhile, Sens.\u00a0Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., are reportedly planning their own proposed legislation to require law enforcement access.\n\nRogers\u2019 comments could indicate a split on this issue between the intelligence community and domestic law enforcement.\n\nA\u00a0former NSA director, Michael Hayden, said in January that he thinks Comey is on the wrong side of this debate. \u201cI disagree with Jim Comey. I actually think end-to-end encryption is good for America,\u201d he said.\n\nHayden has also spoken about\u00a0how U.S. intelligence agencies have figured out how to get the information they need without weakening encryption \u2014 such as using metadata, which shows who is contacting whom. Another former NSA boss, Mike McConnell, has also spoken out against trying to install backdoors in encryption.\n\nLeft unsaid is the fact that the FBI and NSA have the ability to circumvent encryption and get to the content too \u2014 by hacking. Hacking allows law enforcement to plant malicious code on someone\u2019s computer in order to gain access to the photos, messages, and text before they were ever encrypted in the first place, and after they\u2019ve been decrypted. The NSA has an entire team of advanced hackers, possibly as many as 600, camped out at\u00a0Fort Meade.", "wordchoice": ["encryption", "comey", "nsa", "privacy", "access", "fbi", "hacking", "rogers"], "title": "NSA Chief Stakes Out Pro-Encryption Position, in Contrast to FBI"}, {"url": "https://theintercept.com/2016/01/21/howard-dean-despite-denials-has-long-sad-history-of-selling-himself-on-k-street/", "corpus": "Last week, we reported that Howard Dean, former presidential candidate and current supporter of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, had attacked Bernie Sanders for supporting a single-payer health plan, claiming that having the government pay for everyone\u2019s health care would \u201cundo people\u2019s health care\u201d and result in \u201cchaos.\u201d In our story, we noted that Dean, once a proponent of single-payer, now works for the lobbying practice of Dentons, a law firm retained to lobby on behalf of\u00a0a number of pharmaceutical and for-profit health care interests. In response, Dean tweeted: \u201cI continue to support Single pay or [sic] and I do not Lobby.\u201d He tweeted the next day: \u201cThe Intercept=The Daily Caller of the left. Same propaganda techniques.\u201d Dean did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Dentons\u2019 director of communications, Bennett Kleinberg, wrote to us to say, \u201cHoward Dean is a senior advisor with Dentons in our Public Policy and Regulation practice. However, he is not a registered lobbyist and does not lobby public officials on behalf of clients of the Firm.\u201d Since joining the lobbying industry, Dean has oddly argued on multiple occasions that he does \u201cnot lobby.\u201d But he engages in virtually every lobbying activity imaginable, helping corporate interests\u00a0reach out to lawmakers on legislation, advising them on political strategy, and using his credibility as a former liberal lion to build public support on behalf of his lobby firm clients. In his new career, he has helped drug companies maintain monopoly power, reversed his old positions on Medicare prices, and worked to undermine a critical component of the Affordable Care Act. Though known for his anti-war rhetoric in 2004, Dean has accepted money from Mojahedin-e Khalq, an extremist group seeking regime change in Iran and has criticized President Obama\u2019s negotiations with Iran. The fact that Dean is not a registered lobbyist\u00a0reflects a\u00a0distinction that is largely meaningless\u00a0in today\u2019s Washington. Thousands of other professionals in the lobbying business have either never registered or de-registered and\u00a0lobby registration law has almost never been enforced. Newt Gingrich, who was\u00a0widely criticized in 2011 for acting as a lobbyist for various clients without registering, was\u00a0hired last year by\u00a0Dentons\u2019 lobbying practice, where he works closely with Dean to consult with clients on political strategy.\u00a0As Legal Times reported, the Dean-Gingrich team is now a selling point for Dentons as the \u201cpair aims to become another Washington-based bipartisan tag team who can act as political soothsayers for whichever corporate clients call upon them.\u201d In 2009, Dean joined the lobbying division of the law firm McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP, which represents a number of health care interests. Through the firm, he was retained\u00a0that year to work for Biotechnology Industry Organization, or BIO, a lobbying group for biotech and\u00a0pharmaceutical companies. After being retained by BIO, Dean authored an opinion column for The Hill newspaper arguing in support of a bill backed by his client that called for extending the exclusivity period for drugs made from living organisms, such as vaccines\u00a0or Herceptin/trastuzumab, a treatment for breast cancer. Dean claimed in the piece that a \u201ccommonsense and fair approach, similar to the process and timeline currently in place for generic versions of chemical-based medicines, would allow the original developer of the biologic to protect the proprietary data used to develop the medicine for at least 12 years.\u201d Dean\u2019s call for extending the exclusivity period for biologics \u2014 a move that would boost prices for life-saving drugs \u2014\u00a0shocked patient and consumer advocates. Dean did not initially disclose that he was working for BIO in his column, although\u00a0The Hill later updated his byline to note that Dean\u2019s law firm represented biotech companies. The inside story of Dean\u2019s work for the biotech lobby was revealed in an article by BioCentury, a trade publication. According to the report,\u00a0Dean and his former campaign manager Joe Trippi were hired\u00a0by BIO to help move forward the biologic\u00a0legislation backed by the industry.\u00a0Jim Greenwood, the president of BIO, told BioCentury that Dean was brought on to help\u00a0with messaging, strategy, and even to contact lawmakers on Capitol Hill on behalf of the industry. BIO made clear that Dean was hired specifically for his reputation as a liberal. \u201cAs a\u00a0physician clearly focused on health care, a Democrat leader and clearly to left of center, his efforts were impactful,\u201d Greenwood said. Dean defended his efforts to BioCentury by saying, \u201cI do not lobby.\u201d In the end, a version of the biologic legislation was folded into the Affordable Care Act. \u201cHoward Dean navigated around the lobbying rules to push Democrats to back big drug companies on the term of the monopoly for biologic drugs,\u201d said\u00a0Jamie Love, the director\u00a0of Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit organization that addresses human rights aspects of intellectual property rights and medical innovation. \u201cHis \u2018trust me, I\u2019m a doctor\u2019 routine was worth billions to Roche and the other companies he represented on this. Now it is very hard to undo the damage.\u201d\n\nOn\u00a0the 2004 campaign trail, Dean criticized the role of health care lobbyists in setting prescription drug policies, such as the deal engineered by drug companies that prevents Medicare from using its bargaining power as the Veterans Administration does to negotiate for lower drug prices. Such a change would save over $116 billion over 10 years.\u00a0Dean told the Associated Press: \u201cAs president, a high and early legislative priority of my new administration would be to improve the prescription drug benefit to create one that is affordable, federally administered, and for all of America\u2019s seniors; uses the government\u2019s buying power on behalf of 41 million seniors to negotiate and drive down drug prices; contains meaningful cost containment including reimportation of safe, effective medicines.\u201d\n\nBut Dean, whose new employer, Dentons, represents the\u00a0Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the powerful drug lobby group known as\u00a0PhRMA, has now changed his tune. During a discussion with Gingrich last year, Dean reversed his position and said he is now against allowing Medicare to bargain for lower drug prices.\u00a0Dean told the audience that some expensive drugs, like those used to treat hepatitis C, could eventually save money long term, a claim Inside Health Policy noted closely echoed drugmakers\u2019 arguments.\n\nIn September of last year, Dean took his newfound love of drug companies to the pages of the New York Times. In a letter to the editor opposing an op-ed that proposed to allow Medicare to bargain for cheaper prices, Dean wrote that \u201cschemes to launch a federal attack on one of the last growing, innovative industries in America are in the long run counterproductive for both job creation and, more important, for the health of human beings around the world.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Dean again surprised health care advocates by publishing a Wall Street Journal opinion column criticizing a key component of the Affordable Care Act: the Independent Payment Advisory Board, also known as IPAB. The board is designed to allow a group of experts to make recommendations on how Medicare can save money, but only in ways that do not reduce benefits and low-income subsidies or raise premiums. Dean, repeating GOP arguments against the board, called IPAB \u201cessentially a health-care rationing body,\u201d and he said it should be repealed.\n\nHealth policy experts reacted furiously.\u00a0The New Republic writer Jonathan Cohn noted that it was quite puzzling that Dean, supposedly a supporter of government programs designed to use evidence-based approaches to set provider payment rates, would suddenly decide to oppose IPAB. \u201cOr maybe it\u2019s not so strange to hear Dean say this,\u201d Cohn wrote. \u201cSince his career in politics ended, Dean has found a home in the K Street establishment he once held in such disdain.\u201d\n\n\u201cShame on Howard Dean,\u201d wrote economist J. Bradford DeLong, who noted that it appears as though Dean was \u201cbeing mendacious to try to protect the profits of the clients of McKenna Long & Aldridge.\u201d\n\nDean conceded to Time that his firm has clients that oppose IPAB, but refused to disclose them.\n\nAnd in December 2009, as the Affordable Care Act nearly died as conservative opposition grew to a fever pitch and Democratic leaders struggled to find enough votes to move it forward, Dean appeared on national network news programs to call for President Obama to scrap the legislation and start over, a process that would have doomed any chance for health care reform.\n\nThe Mojahedin-e Khalq, an exiled Iranian\u00a0group that has attempted for years to overthrow the government of Iran, paid Dean to help in its\u00a0campaign to be delisted as a U.S.-recognized terrorist group.\u00a0In 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that Dean was receiving speaking fees from the group. Around that time, Dean began vociferously arguing on behalf of the MEK, even though he conceded that he had known little\u00a0about the group before joining its\u00a0cause.\n\nThat year, Dean traveled along with other paid\u00a0MEK supporters, including Rudy Giuliani, to appear\u00a0in Berlin with the group and demand that Western nations recognize the MEK leader\u00a0Maryam Rajavi as the president of Iran. In addition to carrying out a campaign of terrorism against Iran, the MEK\u00a0helped Saddam Hussein after the Gulf War crush rebellions in Iraq\u2019s Shiite and Kurdish communities.\u00a0\u201cTake the Kurds under your tanks, and save your bullets for the Iranian Revolutionary Guards,\u201d Rajavi once said.\n\nIn 2014, Dean came out against President Obama\u2019s policy of engagement with Iran, declaring\u00a0that the U.S. negotiations failed to account for the interests of the MEK. (Dean even spoke on Capitol Hill on behalf of an MEK-affiliated group, which posted the video online.) Last year, Dean continued to advocate against a nuclear accord with Iran, calling Secretary of State John Kerry and Obama \u201cfar, far too eager for a deal with Iran.\u201d\n\nDean\u2019s success on the other side of the revolving door rests in part on his credibility as a left-wing icon. And yet, despite his fiery rhetoric on the campaign trail in 2003, Dean by most accounts governed Vermont as a business-friendly, moderate Democrat. Even his record on single-payer is far less supportive than what he has attempted to project.\n\nIn 1991, as the lieutenant governor of Vermont, Dean testified in support of\u00a0single-payer. But as governor, he quickly backtracked, claiming that single-payer would be too expensive for the state.\n\nJohn McClaughry, Dean\u2019s Republican opponent for governor during the 1991 election, recalls that Dean continually shifted the goal posts for single-payer. \u201cI don\u2019t know that Howard has any fixed principles about this issue \u2014 it\u2019s what sells at the moment,\u201d McClaughry said.\n\nDean\u2019s evolution as a politician is discussed at length during the first Huffington Post podcast Candidate Confessional.\u00a0During the interview, Dean explains that he knew well before the infamous post-Iowa caucus scream that he had little chance of becoming president as an insurrectionist populist. He yearned to be regarded as a serious, establishment-friendly politician, but was too slow in making the transition as a candidate.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t make the turn to become an establishment candidate,\u201d he lamented.", "wordchoice": ["dean", "lobby", "drug", "dentons", "single-payer", "health care", "bio", "mek"], "title": "Howard Dean Says He\u2019s Not a Lobbyist But He Sure Acts Like One"}, {"url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/01/23/steph_curry_nails_two_quarter_ending_half_court_shots_against_the_pacers.html", "corpus": "Steph Curry Steph Curry\u2019d again on Friday night, dropping 39 points to go along with his second triple double of the season during the Golden State Warriors' 122-110 victory over the Indiana Pacers.

In that way, as my colleague Jim Newell noted, he's taking a page out of Trump's but-look-at-the-polls book, which has proved more effective than anyone expected.\n\nJohn Kasich\u2014who is billing himself as \"the Prince of Light and Hope\" on the campaign trail\u2014continued his ongoing assault on his fellow establishment-approved candidates this week.

It has also helped limit access for government employees, military personnel, those in the Peace Corps, and others. It\u2019s become a routine piece of policy, renewed in every federal spending bill since 1976, and frequently becomes a political football, as when President Obama signed an executive order including restrictions along the lines of Hyde in the Affordable Care Act as a way to win support for the bill\u2019s passage.\n\nBut now both frontrunners for the Democratic presidential nomination have come out against it, calling for it to be repealed. Hillary Clinton has repeatedly called for a reversal of Hyde, and now Bernie Sanders has followed suit.\n\nOn Friday, Sanders said in a statement, \u201cWomen must have full control over their reproductive health in order to have full control over their lives. We must rescind the Hyde Amendment and resist attempts by states to erect roadblocks to abortion.\u201d Sanders has voted against the Hyde Amendment while serving in both the House and Senate, but his statement made his intentions clear to repeal it once and for all if elected.\n\nIt also came on the heels of statements he made calling Planned Parenthood and NARAL, both organizations that advocate for abortion rights, part of the \u201cpolitical establishment\u201d that he is \u201ctaking on.\u201d He later tried to backtrack after Planned Parenthood, which has endorsed Clinton, called him out for it.\n\nThe issue of abortion access for low-income women has gained more salience in recent years. The Democratic Party added a plank to its platform in 2012 supporting a woman\u2019s right to abortion \u201cregardless of ability to pay.\u201d And last summer, a group of congressmembers introduced a landmark bill ensuring that government-provided insurance and health care cover abortion services, which would effectively end Hyde.\n\nAbortions can be very costly, particularly when they have to be paid for out of pocket, which is one reason why low-income women are three times less likely to get an abortion and five times more likely to have an unplanned pregnancy. This only exacerbates their situation, as women who seek an abortion but aren\u2019t able to actually get the procedure are three times more likely to fall into poverty over the following years.", "wordchoice": ["abortion", "low-income women", "hyde amendment", "sanders", "repealed", "called", "hillary clinton", "bill"], "title": "Bernie Sanders Calls For Repealing The Hyde Amendment"}, {"url": "http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2016/01/23/3742206/gillian-anderson-pay-gap/", "corpus": "Gillian Anderson, made famous for her portrayal of Dana Scully in the 1993 hit show \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d has revealed she\u2019s long been a victim of the gender pay gap in film and TV.\n\nAnderson will star alongside X-Files co-star David Duchovny in a reboot that premiers on Sunday evening.

At 25 years old when she came in for auditions, she didn\u2019t have many screen credits, while 33-year-old Duchovny had become known for hosting Showtime\u2019s \u201cRed Shoe Diaries.\u201d But the two were still clearly co-stars from the beginning, even if the studio tried to undermine it. Anderson told the Daily Beast that she was initially required to stand a few feet behind him on camera and never to walk side-by-side.\n\nBut Anderson, who says she has \u201ca very short tolerance for that shit,\u201d fought both those rules and the pay gap between what she made for the show and what was given to Duchovny. It took her three years to close the wage gap.\n\nNow she\u2019s had to fight for equal pay all over again, telling the Daily Beast the initial offer of half of Duchovny\u2019s pay is \u201cthe truth.\u201d That\u2019s despite the fact that in the intervening years she\u2019s starred in shows like \u201cThe Fall\u201d and even netted a best actress award for her starring role in \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire. \u201cIt was shocking to me, given all the work that I had done in the past to get us to be paid fairly,\u201d she told the Daily Beast of her lowball offer. \u201cI worked really hard toward that and finally got somewhere with it.\u201d Sources told The Hollywood Reporter that she eventually managed to get equal pay for the upcoming six-episode series.\n\n\u201cEspecially in this climate of women talking about the reality of [unequal pay] in this business, I think it\u2019s important that it gets heard and voiced,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is\u2026 sad. It is sad.\u201d\n\nAs sad as it may be, it\u2019s still common throughout the industry. Many pay disparities were revealed in the Sony hack that made executive emails public, such as the fact that Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams made significantly less for starring alongside Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, and Jeremey Renner in \u201cAmerican Hustle,\u201d or that Charlize Theron was paid $10 million less than Chris Hemsworth for \u201cThe Huntsman.\u201d Lilly Tomlin and Jane Fonda, co-starts of the Netflix show \u201cGrace and Frankie,\u201d revealed last year that the supporting actors, Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston, were given the exact same pay as them. Amanda Seyfried says she was paid just 10 percent of what her male co-star made for a big-budget film. British actress Sienna Miller said she was offered less than half of what was offered to a male co-star for a Broadway play and decided to turn down the role.\n\nOverall, the highest-paid actors make far more than the top-paid actresses. Robert Downey, Jr., the best-paid actor of them all, makes more than the combined pay of the two actresses at the top, Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Lawrence. Actresses get fewer chances to play the leading roles that make the big bucks, but they also bring in more money for studios when they do.\n\nAnd while Hollywood and TV stars may be able to weather unfair pay given how much they make, these gaps are indicative of the fact that women make less than men in every industry and in virtually every job.", "wordchoice": ["actresses", "duchovny", "anderson", "starring", "pay", "actors", "sad", "studio"], "title": "Studio Tried To Pay Gillian Anderson Half Of What It Paid David Duchovny For X-Files Reboot.

But for hundreds of homeless families from the DC area, that means potentially being stranded for days in motel rooms outside the city with no access to food.\n\nIn an attempt to shelter its homeless population, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s (D) administration started putting people in empty motel rooms because it had run out of shelter space. There were 211 families, including almost 700 people, in motels in Maryland as the storm began, close to a record number, the Washington Post reports. There are likely more in motels throughout the area, as more than 430 families were placed in rooms over the summer and an additional 450 were put in motels since November.\n\nAnd those families, many of them young single mothers caring for multiple children, have no way to reach grocery stores and could be stranded in the rooms for days. Laura Green Zeilinger, the District\u2019s head of homeless services, said city workers had already started trying to reach the families before the storm began, bringing bags of groceries and meal cards. But she also admitted that they will be stuck where they are. \u201cYes, they will be marooned, just like everybody in the city will be marooned,\u201d she told the Post.\n\nThe city is also grappling with those who may still be outside in the blizzard conditions. Dozens of people were still camped outside in downtown DC on Friday. To help get people indoors, the city has declared a cold weather emergency that requires shelters to stay open and serve meals throughout the day so that homeless residents don\u2019t have to leave , and it opened recreation centers as temporary shelters for single people and some couples who can stay together. Caseworkers and police are also canvassing the city to determine if homeless people who are still outside can make rational decisions and force them inside if they can\u2019t. \u201cWe do have authority to make sure they are safe and inside,\u201d Bowser said at a news conference.\n\nWinter weather, even in less extreme conditions, can be deadly for those who stay outside and have nowhere indoors to go. In 2014, 55 homeless people died on DC\u2019s streets from things like exposure or violence, while an estimated 2,000 homeless people died around the country. Hypothermia can set in even in weather as warm as 50 degrees, but many cities don\u2019t declare hypothermia alerts or winter emergencies, which trigger the opening of extra shelter space, until 40 degrees or lower, with some waiting until it\u2019s in the teens. And many cities run out of emergency space anyway.\n\nAdvocates warn, however, that forcing people indoors isn\u2019t the best solution to the problem. They say that it\u2019s not that people need to be coerced into accepting help, but that enough help \u2014 in the form of affordable, permanent housing \u2014 just isn\u2019t available. A number of cities and one state have proven that the solution can be simply housing entire homeless populations \u2014 in their cases, all homeless veterans \u2014 if enough resources are committed to the effort.", "wordchoice": ["homeless", "dc", "people", "motels", "city", "shelter", "families", "marooned"], "title": "DC\u2019s Plan To Put Homeless Families In Motel Rooms Could Backfire During Winter Storm"}, {"url": "http://thinkprogress.org/culture/2016/01/22/3742150/pope-francis-cant-stand-trolls/", "corpus": "Pope Francis has taken a stand against many things since becoming Bishop of Rome, firing clerics who spend too much money on themselves, blasting corrupt Catholic officials, and shaming people who turn away Syrian refugees.\n\nBut now the Holy Father is bringing his moral authority to bear against one of his toughest enemies yet: Internet trolls.\n\nOn Friday, the pontiff posted a new address to the Vatican website to mark World Communications Day. In it, he praised the potential benefits of technology to help people communicate, but also warned against the tendency for digital discourse to morph into anger-fueled flame wars.\n\n\u201cSocial networks can facilitate relationships and promote the good of society, but they can also lead to further polarization and division between individuals and groups,\u201d Francis writes. \u201cThe digital world is a public square, a meeting-place where we can either encourage or demean one another, engage in a meaningful discussion or unfair attacks\u2026Access to digital networks entails a responsibility for our neighbor whom we do not see but who is nonetheless real and has a dignity which must be respected.\u201d\n\nThe famously \u201ctweetable pope\u201d is well-known for his embrace of technology, and the message follows back-to-back meetings this month between the Holy Father and two giants of Silicon Valley \u2014\u00a0Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google parent company Alphabet, and Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\nYet Francis is one of the first \u2014 and one of the most influential \u2014 religious leaders to offer a theological lens for grappling with the growing issue of online harassment, a problem with an ever-increasing scope. According to a 2014 Pew Research study, 40 percent of internet users have personally experienced online harassment, with women and minorities disproportionately affected.\n\nThe tech industry has struggled to create systems to grapple with the issue. Organizers of the South by Southwest conference canceled two online harassment panels last October after news of the panels resulted in violent threats, only to reschedule a day-long summit on the issue after big-name digital media companies Vox and Buzzfeed threatened to pull out of the convening. Meanwhile, Twitter updated its anti-harassment polices in December 2015 to target online abuse, but critics say the changes simply repackage existing policies that many argue are ineffective.\n\nMany blame the ubiquity of online harassment on the ability to remain anonymous while attacking someone else on the internet. But the pontiff noted that, from a moral perspective, such arguments ignore the fundamental truth of digital communication: the screen name you yell at online isn\u2019t a robot \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s a person.\n\n\u201cEmails, text messages, social networks and chats can also be fully human forms of communication,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt is not technology which determines whether or not communication is authentic, but rather the human heart and our capacity to use wisely the means at our disposal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a broken, fragmented and polarized world, to communicate with mercy means to help create a healthy, free and fraternal closeness between the children of God and all our brothers and sisters in the one human family.\u201d", "wordchoice": ["online harassment", "digital", "internet", "francis", "communication", "human", "grappling", "holy father"], "title": "Apparently Pope Francis Can\u2019t Stand Internet Trolls Either"}, {"url": "http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/01/22/3742121/atlantic-coast-pipeline-route-rejected/", "corpus": "A massive interstate natural gas pipeline proposed to run through two national forests suffered a setback Thursday, as the proposed route was rejected following concerns about endangered wildlife.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service said in documents that the $5 billion Atlantic Coast Pipeline and its 550-mile route lacks \u201cminimum requirements\u201d to safeguard wildlife.

Indeed, the project is still in the early parts of permitting process \u2014 it filed for permits with FERC in September 2015.\n\nYet coming up with a different route is a setback. In its letter, the U.S. Forest Service said the Atlantic Coast Pipeline has to avoid the Cheat Mountain and the Black Allegheny Mountain, the latter located in the Appalachians. The new route also has to address the Cow Knob salamander, a candidate to be added to the Endangered Species List. Salamanders as a whole are the most endangered vertebrates in the world.\n\nEnvironmentalists also note that the project threatens mussels, bats, and multiple other species as it would fragment habitat and isolate populations. \u201cThis pipeline would have very serious and irreversible impacts on some of the rarest and most valuable natural treasures in the U.S.,\u201d David Sligh, Wild Virginia conservation director, told ThinkProgress.\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Pipeline is just one of four other proposed similar projects, which include the Appalachian Connector and the Mountain Valley Pipeline. All these projects \u2014 proposed by different companies \u2014 threaten wildlife, environmentalists reached Friday said. They called on permitting agencies to examine the cumulative effects of all these pipelines before approving any single project.\n\n\u201cWe ask that they require that there be a programmatic environmental impact statement which would look at all of the impacts, all of these pipelines together, to consider whether any of them should be permitted,\u201d said Ernie Reed, president of Wild Virginia.\n\nWide-ranging programmatic environmental impact statements affecting multiple companies in a single industry do exist. Solar energy development follows one that covers Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah.\n\nBut while there\u2019s much opposition to the pipeline, there are many who have supported it, including Virginia\u2019s democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe. \u201cThis project is a game changer for Virginia\u2019s economy, and the benefits will be both immediate and long-lasting,\u201d the governor said in a statement when the project was first announced in 2014, according to published reports. The pipeline could produce $1.42 billion in economic activity and support 8,800 new jobs in the state, he said.", "wordchoice": ["pipeline", "route", "virginia", "salamanders", "endangered", "project", "permitting", "wildlife"], "title": "Officials Reject Gas Pipeline Route That Would Have Run Through National Forests"}, {"url": "http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2016/01/22/3742061/flint-water-church-undocumented/", "corpus": "Undocumented immigrants facing the water contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan may be too scared to go to the water distribution centers because they may not be able to produce proper identification, according to a local ABC affiliate.\n\nLucia, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who came to the country 23 years ago, has lived in Flint for over a decade. She told ABC that she has been buying bottled water, but that she is too afraid to access the water distribution centers set up around the city for residents.\n\n\u201cI got close to see what they were giving out, and it was water. And the first thing they asked me for was my license,\u201d she said. She left, fearing that she would be arrested or deported if they found out about her immigration status.\n\nThe publication added that many of Flint\u2019s roughly 1,000 undocumented residents are likely too afraid to open the doors to volunteers who have been going door-to-door to hand out water, cartridges, and filters. Lucia likely does not have state identification because Michigan law prevents undocumented immigrants from applying for driver\u2019s licenses and other forms of identification without proof of legal presence. Only immigrants covered under a federal deportation deferral initiative known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program are eligible for state identification.\n\nFlint has dealt with elevated levels of chemicals in the water system after the city, in an effort to save money, changed the source of drinking water from Lake Huron to the Flint River last April under a state-appointed emergency manager. The city sent out notices about the elevated levels of chemicals, but didn\u2019t explicitly mention lead. But the state Department of Environmental Quality has since admitted that it didn\u2019t use needed chemicals to be added to the corrosive Flint River water, causing lead to leach from the pipes and contaminate the city\u2019s drinking water. Flint Mayor Karen Weaver declared a state of emergency in December 2015, while Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) declared a state of emergency in January 2016. National Guards were deployed a week later to distribute clean water and filters.\n\nAt least one local church is stepping up efforts to get clean and bottled water out to undocumented immigrants. St. Mary\u2019s Catholic Church is handing out water to community members \u201cwith no questions asked, no identification needed,\u201d Kathleen Tomczyk at St. Mary\u2019s Catholic Church told ThinkProgress in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cOur church is in a mixed and diversified neighborhood,\u201d Tomczyk said. \u201cWe don\u2019t turn anyone away, regardless of nationality.\u201d\n\nTomczyk said that the community has been very responsive in light of ABC\u2019s broadcast, noting that by Wednesday night, she had people wanting to help with translation and people wanting to help deliver water. She also said that people from all over Michigan have called, including a couple from Saginaw who brought in 13 cases of water and a woman who wanted to bring in \u201cpallets\u201d of water bottles.\n\n\u201cThe community is awesome,\u201d Tomczyk said. \u201cIt\u2019s God\u2019s work. He\u2019s bringing out the best in a lot of people.\u201d\n\nSt. Mary\u2019s is not the only church stepping up efforts to distribute clean water supplies to Flint residents. Pastor Bobby Jackson at Mission of Hope has been handing out water to homeless and low-income residents since last year. After the city switched water sources and the city distributed literature about the elevated level of chemicals, his church became one of the first responders. \u201cWe are the first emergency water site to go into effect,\u201d he told ThinkProgress reporters Erica Hellerstein and Bryce Covert. His church has been distributing about 30 cases every hour.\n\nStill, despite community efforts, Lucia is not the only undocumented immigrant who\u2019s afraid to access emergency relief during disasters. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, James Ziglar, the former Commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, had to release a statement encouraging undocumented immigrants to contact local law enforcement if they believed that they lost loved ones in the attack. After Hurricane Katrina, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) released a statement noting that undocumented parents could apply for disaster aid on behalf of their children with legal status.", "wordchoice": ["water", "undocumented immigrants", "flint", "church", "identification", "tomczyk", "lucia", "emergency"], "title": "How The Flint Water Crisis Is Impacting Undocumented Immigrants"}, {"url": "http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/01/22/3742081/blm-announces-methane-rule/", "corpus": "In an effort to curb emissions and prevent waste of taxpayer dollars, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) on Friday announced its long-awaited draft rule regarding methane pollution on public lands.\n\nThe draft rule will slash the venting, flaring, and leaking of methane \u2014 the main component in natural gas \u2014 from new and existing oil and gas operations on public lands. It will do so by requiring the oil and gas industry to take measures to reduce the instances of venting and flaring and to plug leaks through equipment upgrades. The rule is expected to reduce both venting and flaring by at least 41 percent and could prevent up to 169,000 tons of methane emissions per year.\n\nThe rule is considered a key component of President Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan.\n\n\u201cI think most people would agree that we should be using our nation\u2019s natural gas to power our economy \u2014 not wasting it by venting and flaring it into the atmosphere,\u201d said Interior Secretary Sally Jewell in a statement. \u201cWe need to modernize decades-old standards to reflect existing technologies so that we can cut down on harmful methane emissions and use this captured natural gas to generate power and provide a return to taxpayers, tribes and states for this public resource.\u201d\n\nThe rule earned praise from a wide range of supporters and stakeholders, including conservation groups, sportsmen and women, tribal leaders, western congressional delegations, and consumer watchdog groups. According to a recent poll done by Colorado College, the rule also has bipartisan support among western voters, with 80 percent of westerners supporting a rule to prevent leaked and wasted natural gas on public lands.\n\nThe Environmental Defense Fund estimates that 1 million metric tons of useful natural gas resources were vented or flared on public and tribal lands in 2013 alone and that 40 percent of that gas could be economically captured with currently available technologies. BLM Director Neil Kornze said in a press statement that the rule will save as much energy as could be used to power every household in Dallas and Denver combined, every year.\n\nBecause the sale of natural gas on public lands is an important source of public revenue, when methane pollution is vented or flared taxpayers and tribal governments cannot collect deserved royalties. According to a recent report by the Western Values Project, without the rule, taxpayers could conservatively lose almost $800 million over the next decade from the venting and flaring of natural gas on public lands.\n\n\u201cNew Mexico\u2019s natural resources provide jobs and royalty payments and are an important part of our state\u2019s economy. But over $100 million worth of those natural gas resources are being wasted each year due to outdated requirements, costing the state of New Mexico $43 million in lost royalties since 2009,\u201d the four members of the New Mexico delegation said in a joint statement Friday.\n\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas that traps more than 25 times the heat of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that more than 50 percent of the warming in the next two decades will come from short-lived pollutants like methane, making its immediate regulation even more important. With the U.S. being the largest natural gas producer in the world and 2015 having just been declared the hottest year on record, setting strong methane regulations to reduce leakage and waste is, according to the White House, \u201ccritical to our overall effort to address climate change.\u201d\n\nIn addition to cutting climate-warming methane emissions, the new standards will curb emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and carcinogens like benzene, protecting public health as well. VOCs and NOx can lead to the production of ground-level ozone and smog which can lead to reduced visibility on public lands and respiratory complications for outdoor enthusiasts. Former BLM directors Bob Abbey and Mike Dombeck have stressed the dangers of air pollution in basins such as San Juan, Uintah, and Upper Green River, in part due to pollution from oil and gas operations.\n\n\u201cBeyond their climate implications, these regulations will begin to minimize waste of a valuable energy resource, ensuring that taxpayers are compensated for use of our public lands, as well as reduce accompanying toxic air pollutants that are harming local communities,\u201d said the League of Conservation Voters in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s proposal is a win all around: for our environment, public health, taxpayers, and our energy security.\u201d\n\nThe BLM\u2019s proposed rule comes on the heels of the EPA\u2019s proposed rule to reduce methane pollution from new and modified oil and gas operations. Together these rules aim to fufil the White House\u2019s goal of reducing methane emissions by 40 \u2013 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025.\n\nJenny Rowland is the Research and Advocacy Associate for the Public Lands Project at Center for American Progress.

Nearly 300 people reported getting sick after eating at the Simi Valley restaurant.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges the Chipotle manager closed the restaurant, citing a staffing shortage, but did so in an attempt to implement the \u201cNorwalk Protocol\u201d and conceal a potential outbreak.\n\nInstead of telling customers the truth, Plaintiffs are informed and believe that Chipotle\u2019s Area Manager, Scotty Shadix, told Eric Rose and his neighbors who went to the Chipotle Simi Valley restaurant on Thursday, August 20, 2015 to complain they had become sick from eating food purchased during the previous two days that there was no problem with their food and the restaurant was closed due to a \u201cstaffing shortage.\u201d Instead of admitting there had been a foodborne illness outbreak, Chipotle\u2019s Area Manager gave Mr. Rose his business card with a handwritten note on it saying \u201c1 Free Entr\u00e9e @ Simi Valley only.\u201d\n\nBased on the complaint, a Chipotle official contacted Ventura County\u2019s health department two days after launching the alleged clean-up campaign. The food program manager with the county\u2019s Environmental Health Division Doug Beach told the Ventura County Star the department wasn\u2019t able to do a proper investigation because everything had been cleaned up by the time it was alerted to the problem\n\n\u201cBecause they had already shut the restaurant down, thrown out all the food, completely cleaned the place up, went top to bottom with bleach, and brought in a new staff, we didn\u2019t have any opportunity to sample food or do some of the things we normally do to investigate a foodborne outbreak,\u201d Beach said. \u201cHad we known earlier, we potentially could have prevented more people from getting sick.\u201d\n\nNews of the lawsuit comes days after Chipotle announced all of its restaurants would close February 8 for nationwide food safety training in light of the company\u2019s months-long bout with E. Coli, Salmonella, and norovirus outbreaks.\n\nMore than 200 people reported getting sick after eating at the Simi Valley restaurant, outbreaks of E. coli spread nationwide, and Chipotle restaurants in Minnesota struggled with a statewide Salmonella outbreak.
